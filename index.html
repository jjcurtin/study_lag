<meta name="citation_abstract" content="We developed machine learning models to predict future alcohol lapses within 24-hour windows lagged 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks. We engineered features from 4x daily ecological momentary assessment from individuals (N=151; 51% male; mean age=41; 87% non-Hispanic White) in early recovery over three months. We trained and evaluated models using nested cross-validation. Median posterior auROC was high (0.85–0.91) for all models but decreased modestly with increasing lag. Models performed worse for non-advantaged groups (non-White and/or Hispanic, below poverty, female). Past alcohol use, abstinence self-efficacy, and craving were the most important features, with the magnitude of importance varying meaningfully by lag. These findings demonstrate feasibility of predicting next-day lapses up to two weeks in advance. Embedding these models in a recovery monitoring support system could enable adaptive, personalized care. Improving model fairness and optimizing the delivery of model feedback to sustain engagement remain critical next steps.

The sample was composed of adults receiving publicly funded outpatient treatment in Washington State. Treatment data were linked to data from the US census. The outcome studied was “Initiation and Engagement” in treatment (IET), a measure noting timely receipt of services at the beginning of treatment. Community characteristics studied included community level economic disadvantage and concentration of American Indian, Latino, and Black residents in the community. Black and American Indian clients were less likely to initiate or engage in treatment compared to non-Latino white clients, and American Indian clients living in economically disadvantaged communities were at even greater risk of not initiating treatment. Community economic disadvantage and racial/ethnic makeup of the community were associated with treatment initiation, but not engagement, although they did not entirely explain the disparities found in IET.;,citation_author=Andrea Acevedo;,citation_author=Lee Panas;,citation_author=Deborah Garnick;,citation_author=Dolores Acevedo-Garcia;,citation_author=Jennifer Miles;,citation_author=Grant Ritter;,citation_author=Kevin Campbell;,citation_publication_date=2018-10;,citation_cover_date=2018-10;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1007/s11414-018-9586-y;,citation_issn=1556-3308;,citation_volume=45;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of Behavioral Health Services &amp;amp;amp; Research;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Leveraging Mobile Phone Sensors, Machine Learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence to Predict Imminent Same-Day Binge Drinking Events to Support Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions: A Feasibility Study;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Digital Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) can reduce binge drinking events (BDEs: consuming 4+/5+ drinks per occasion for women/men) in young adults, but need to be optimized for timing and content. Delivering just-in-time support messages in the hours prior to BDEs could improve intervention impact. OBJECTIVE: We determined the feasibility of developing a machine learning model to accurately predict future, that is, same-day, 1 to 6-hours prior BDEs using smartphone sensor data. We aimed to identify the most informative phone sensor features associated with BDEs on weekend and weekdays, respectively, to determine the key features that explain prediction model performance. METHODS: We collected phone sensor data from 75 young adults (ages 21-25; mean =22.4, SD=1.9) with risky drinking behavior who reported drinking behavior over 14 weeks. Participants in this secondary analysis were enrolled in a clinical trial. We developed machine learning models testing different algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, decision tree) to predict same-day BDEs (versus low-risk drinking events and non-drinking periods) using smartphone sensor data (e.g., accelerometer, GPS). We tested various &amp;amp;amp;quot;prediction distance&amp;quot; time windows (more proximal: 1-hour; to distant: 6-hour) from drinking onset. We also tested various analysis time windows (i.e., amount of data to be analyzed), ranging from 1 to 12 hours prior to drinking onset, because this determines the amount of data that needs to be stored on the phone to compute the model. Explainable AI (XAI) was used to explore interactions between the most informative phone sensor features contributing to BDEs. RESULTS: The XGBoost model performed best in predicting imminent same-day BDE, with 95.0% accuracy on weekends and 94.3% accuracy on weekdays (F1 score = 0.95 and 0.94, respectively). This XGBoost model needed 12- and 9-hours of phone sensor data at 3- and 6- hours prediction distance from the onset of drinking, on weekends and weekdays, respectively, prior to predicting same-day BDEs. The most informative phone sensor features for BDE prediction were time (e.g., time of day) and GPS-derived, such as radius of gyration (an indicator of travel). Interactions among key features (e.g., time of day, GPS-derived features) contributed to prediction of same-day BDE. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the feasibility and potential use of smartphone sensor data and machine learning to accurately predict imminent (same-day) BDEs in young adults. The prediction model provides &quot;windows of opportunity&quot; and with the adoption of XAI, we identified &quot;key contributing features&quot; to trigger JITAI prior to the onset of BDEs, with the potential to reduce the likelihood of BDEs in young adults.;,citation_author=Sang Won Bae;,citation_author=Brian Suffoletto;,citation_author=Tongze Zhang;,citation_author=Tammy Chung;,citation_author=Melik Ozolcer;,citation_author=Mohammad Rahul Islam;,citation_author=Anind Dey;,citation_publication_date=2023-02;,citation_cover_date=2023-02;,citation_year=2023;,citation_doi=10.2196/39862;,citation_issn=2561-326X;,citation_pmid=36809294;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=JMIR formative research;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mobile phone sensors and supervised machine learning to identify alcohol use events in young adults: Implications for just-in-time adaptive interventions;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Real-time detection of drinking could improve timely delivery of interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related injury, but existing detection methods are burdensome or impractical. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether phone sensor data and machine learning models are useful to detect alcohol use events, and to discuss implications of these results for just-in-time mobile interventions. METHODS: 38 non-treatment seeking young adult heavy drinkers downloaded AWARE app (which continuously collected mobile phone sensor data), and reported alcohol consumption (number of drinks, start/end time of prior day’s drinking) for 28days. We tested various machine learning models using the 20 most informative sensor features to classify time periods as non-drinking, low-risk (1 to 3/4 drinks per occasion for women/men), and high-risk drinking ($&amp;amp;amp;gt;$4/5 drinks per occasion for women/men). RESULTS: Among 30 participants in the analyses, 207 non-drinking, 41 low-risk, and 45 high-risk drinking episodes were reported. A Random Forest model using 30-min windows with 1day of historical data performed best for detecting high-risk drinking, correctly classifying high-risk drinking windows 90.9% of the time. The most informative sensor features were related to time (i.e., day of week, time of day), movement (e.g., change in activities), device usage (e.g., screen duration), and communication (e.g., call duration, typing speed). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence suggests that sensor data captured from mobile phones of young adults is useful in building accurate models to detect periods of high-risk drinking.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Adaptation, personalization and capacity in mental health treatments: A balancing act?;,citation_abstract=Purpose of review&nbsp; There are increasing calls for mental health treatments to be adapted for different groups to maximize their acceptability and benefit to patients. However, adaptations can be costly to develop and evaluate, difficult to implement in routine clinical practice and may reduce service capacity at a time when there is unprecedented unmet need. An alternative method is personalization on an individual level. This review provides an overview of the issues related to personalization and adaptation of mental health interventions. Recent findings&nbsp; Several terms have been used to describe changes to existing therapies, these reflect different extents to which existing treatments have been changed. Evidence-based practice and modular therapies allow a level of flexibility within intervention delivery without formal changes and not all changes to therapy should be considered as a new/adapted treatment but instead regarded as “metacompetence”. Implementing existing interventions in new contexts is preferable to developing new interventions in many instances. New guidance outlines how researchers can adapt and transfer interventions to varied contexts. Summary&nbsp; The review provides proposed definitions of different changes to therapy. Modified and personalized treatments may improve acceptability to patients whilst maximizing implementation of evidence-based practice within clinical services.;,citation_author=Sophie D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Designing m-Health interventions for precision mental health support;,citation_abstract=Mobile health (m-Health) resources are emerging as a significant tool to overcome mental health support access barriers due to their ability to rapidly reach and provide support to individuals in need of mental health support. m-Health provides an approach to adapt and initiate mental health support at precise moments, when they are most likely to be effective for the individual. However, poor adoption of mental health apps in the real world suggests that new approaches to optimising the quality of m-Health interventions are critically needed in order to realise the potential translational benefits for mental health support. The micro-randomised trial is an experimental approach for optimising and adapting m-Health resources. This trial design provides data to construct and optimise m-Health interventions. The data can be used to inform when and what type of m-Health interventions should be initiated, and thus serve to integrate interventions into daily routines with precision. Here, we illustrate this approach in a case study, review implementation issues that need to be considered while conducting an MRT, and provide a checklist for mental health m-Health intervention developers.;,citation_author=N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relapse and relapse prevention;,citation_abstract=Abstract Most psychological disorders and problem behaviors are characterized by very high rates of postremittance relapse. Thus, advances in the long-term efficacy of psychological interventions require understanding the causes and processes of relapse, with the ultimate goal of developing strategies that reduce the probability of relapse. Existing psychological theory and interventions relevant to relapse and relapse prevention (RP) are reviewed, with a focus on addictive behaviors. The past two decades have produced increased attention toward the relapse problem and important advances in the conceptualization of relapse (i.e., as a process rather than a discrete event). Further progress will require the translation of basic theory into applied theory, the development of integrative theories of relapse, and the design and testing of theory-based, multimodal RP interventions.;,citation_author=Thomas H.

Addiction-comprehensive health enhancement support system (A-CHESS) is a smartphone application that aims to reduce relapse. To offer targeted support to patients who are at risk of lapses within the coming week, a Bayesian network model to predict such events was constructed using responses on 2,934 weekly surveys (called the Weekly Check-in) from 152 alcohol-dependent individuals who recently completed residential treatment. The Weekly Check-in is a self-monitoring service, provided in A-CHESS, to track patients’ recovery progress. The model showed good predictability, with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.829 in the 10-fold cross-validation and 0.912 in the external validation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Treatment use, perceived need, and barriers to seeking treatment for substance abuse and mental health problems among older adults compared to younger adults;,citation_abstract=Background This study examined age group differences in and correlates of treatment use and perceived treatment need for substance use disorders (SUD) and mental health (MH) problems as well as self-reported barriers to treatment among people 65+ years old vs. 26–34, 35–49, and 50–64 years old. Methods Data are from the 2008 to 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) (N=96,966). Age group differences were examined using descriptive bivariate analyses and binary logistic regression analyses. Results The 65+ age group was least likely to use treatment and perceive treatment need, but the 50–64 age group was more similar to the younger age groups than the 65+ age group. Controlling for age, other predisposing, and enabling factors, alcohol and illicit drug dependence and comorbid SUD and MH problems increased the odds of SUD treatment use. Of MH problems, anxiety disorder had the largest odds for MH treatment use. Bivariate analyses showed that lack of readiness to stop using and cost/limited insurance were the most frequent barriers to SUD and MH treatment, respectively, among older adults, and they were less likely than younger age groups to report stigma/confidentiality concerns for MH treatment. Conclusions Older adults will become a larger portion of the total U.S. population with SUD and/or MH problems.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Intraindividual Dynamic Network Analysis - Implications for Clinical Assessment;,citation_abstract=A network analysis approach to psychopathology regards symptoms as mutually interacting components of a multifaceted system (Borsboom &amp;amp;amp; Cramer, 2013). Although several studies using this approach have examined comorbidity between disorders using cross-sectional samples, a direct application of the network analysis approach to intraindividual dynamic relations between symptoms in a complex, comorbid case has not been reported. The current article describes an intraindividual dynamic network analysis (IDNA) approach to understanding the psychopathology of an individual using dynamic (over time) lead-lag interrelations between symptoms. Multivariate time series data were utilized to create and examine an intraindividual, lag-1 network of the partial, day-to-day relations of symptoms in an individual with comorbid mood and anxiety disorders. Characteristics of the network, including centrality indices, stability, dynamic processes between symptoms, and their implications for clinical assessment are described. Additional clinical implications and future directions for IDNA, including the potential incremental validity of this assessment approach for empirically-based idiographic assessment and personalized treatment planning, are discussed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Depression From a Precision Mental Health Perspective: Utilizing Personalized Conceptualizations to Guide Personalized Treatments;,citation_abstract=$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$p$&amp;gt;$Modern research has proven that the “typical patient” requiring standardized treatments does not exist, reflecting the need for more personalized approaches for managing individual clinical profiles rather than broad diagnoses. In this regard, precision psychiatry has emerged focusing on enhancing prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric disorders through identifying clinical subgroups, suggesting personalized evidence-based interventions, assessing the effectiveness of different interventions, and identifying risk and protective factors for remission, relapse, and vulnerability. Literature shows that recent advances in the field of precision psychiatry are rapidly becoming more data-driven reflecting both the significance and the continuous need for translational research in mental health. Different etiologies underlying depression have been theorized and some factors have been identified including neural circuitry, biotypes, biopsychosocial markers, genetics, and metabolomics which have shown to explain individual differences in pathology and response to treatment. Although the precision approach may prove to enhance diagnosis and treatment decisions, major challenges are hindering its clinical translation. These include the clinical diversity of psychiatric disorders, the technical complexity and costs of multiomics data, and the need for specialized training in precision health for healthcare staff, besides ethical concerns such as protecting the privacy and security of patients’ data and maintaining health equity. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of recent findings in the conceptualization and treatment of depression from a precision mental health perspective and to discuss potential challenges and future directions in the application of precision psychiatry for the treatment of depression.$&amp;lt;$/p$&amp;gt;$;,citation_author=Reem Deif;,citation_author=Mohamed Salama;,citation_publication_date=2021-05;,citation_cover_date=2021-05;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2021.650318;,citation_issn=1664-0640;,citation_volume=12;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychiatry;,citation_publisher=Frontiers;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The history, current status, and possible future of precision mental health;,citation_abstract=In evidence-based mental health practice, decisions must often be made for which there is little or no empirical basis. A common example of this is when there are multiple empirically supported interventions for a person with a given diagnosis, where the aim is to recommend the treatment most likely to be effective for that person. Data obtained from randomized clinical trials allow for the identification of patient characteristics that could be used to match patients to treatments. Historically, researchers have focused on individual moderators, single variables that interact statistically with treatment type, but these have rarely proved powerful enough to inform treatment decisions. Recently, researchers have begun to explore ways in which the use of multivariable algorithms might improve clinical decision-making. Common pitfalls have been identified, including the use of methods that provide overoptimistic estimates of the gains that can be expected from the applications of an algorithm in a clinical setting. It is too early to tell if these efforts will pay off and, if so, how much their use can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of mental health systems.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Toward a dynamic model of psychological assessment: Implications for personalized care;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: The present article proposes a general framework and a set of specific methodological steps for conducting person-specific dynamic assessments, which yield information about syndrome structures and states that can be used to provide actionable information for the formulation of personalized interventions. It is proposed that researchers should (a) determine the relevant constituent inputs for a diagnostic system; (b) measure these inputs with as much detail as possible; (c) assess the correlational structure of system inputs via factor-analytic methods within individuals; and (d) subject the individual-level, latent dimension time series to dynamic analyses such as the dynamic factor model (Molenaar, 1985) to discern the time-dependent, dynamic relationships within and between system components. METHOD: An exemplar is provided wherein 10 individuals with clinically diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder completed surveys related to generalized anxiety disorder symptomatology for at least 60 consecutive days. These data were then subjected to person-specific exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses for the identification of latent symptom dimensions. Finally, dynamic factor models were used to model the dynamic interrelationships within and between symptom domains on a person-by-person basis. RESULTS: Person-specific factor analyses returned models with 3 (n = 8) or 4 (n = 2) latent factors, all with excellent fit. Dynamic factor modeling successfully revealed the contemporaneous correlations and time-lagged predictive relationships between factors, providing prescriptive information for the formulation of targeted interventions.

Design and Measurements:&nbsp; Buprenorphine providers within a 25-mile radius of the county with the highest drug-related death rates within the 10 states with the highest drug-related death rates were identified and called to determine whether the provider worked there, prescribed buprenorphine, accepted insurance, had appointments, or charged for visits. Results:&nbsp; The number of providers listed in each county ranged from 1 to 166, with 5 counties having $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$10 providers. In 3 counties no appointments were obtained, and another 3 counties had $\leq$3 providers with availability. Of the 505 providers listed, 355 providers (70.3%) were reached, 310 (61.4%) of the 505 listings were correct numbers, and 195 (38.6%) of the 505 providers in the listings provided buprenorphine. Of the 173 clinics that provided buprenorphine and were asked about insurance, 131 (75.7%) accepted insurance. Of the 167 clinics that provided buprenorphine and were asked about Medicaid, 105 (62.9%) accepted it. Wait times for appointments ranged from 1 to 120 days, with an average of 16.8 days for those that had a waitlist. Among the 39 providers who reported out-of-pocket costs, the average cost was $231 (range: $90 to $600). One hundred forty of the 505 providers listed in the database had appointments available (27.7%). Three hundred sixty-five of the 505 providers did not have appointments available (72.3%) for various reasons, including the fact that 120 providers (32.9% of the 365 providers) could not be reached, and 137 of the numbers (37.5% of the 365 listed numbers) were wrong. Other reasons appointments could not be obtained included the fact that providers did not treat outpatients, were not accepting new patients, were out of office, or required a referral. Conclusion:&nbsp; Although the SAMHSA buprenorphine practitioner locator is used by patients and providers to locate treatment options, only a small portion of clinicians in the database ultimately offered initial appointments, implying that the database is only marginally useful for patients.;,citation_author=Lila Flavin;,citation_author=Monica Malowney;,citation_author=Nikhil A.

Economic burden estimates that describe the impact of the crisis are needed when considering federal and state resources devoted to addressing overdoses. In this study, we estimate the societal costs for opioid use disorder and fatal overdose from all opioids in 2017. Methods We estimated costs of fatal overdose from all opioids and opioid use disorder based on the incidence of overdose deaths and the prevalence of past-year opioid use disorder for 2017. Incidence of fatal opioid overdose was obtained from the National Vital Statistics System; prevalence of past-year opioid use disorder was estimated from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health. Costs were estimated for health care, criminal justice and lost productivity. Costs for the reduced quality of life for opioid use disorder and life lost due to fatal opioid overdose were valued using U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for valuing reductions in morbidity and mortality. Results Costs for opioid use disorder and fatal opioid overdose in 2017 were estimated to be $1.02 trillion. The majority of the economic burden is due to reduced quality of life from opioid use disorder and the value of life lost due to fatal opioid overdose. Conclusions These estimates can assist decision makers in understanding the magnitude of opioid use disorder and fatal overdose.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The effect of matching comprehensive services to patients’ needs on drug use improvement in addiction treatment;,citation_abstract=Aims To examine whether need–service matching in addiction treatment leads to improvements in drug use, and whether treatment duration mediates those improvements. Design, participants, measurements This analysis utilizes prospective data from a US cohort of addiction treatment patients who reported service needs beyond core rehabilitative services (n = 3103). “Drug use improvement” is the difference between the patient’s peak drug use frequency (in days per month) in the year before intake and in the year after treatment. Overall and primary use of the major illicit drugs (heroin, powder or crack cocaine and marijuana) are considered separately. “Need–service match” means that a patient rated a service as important at intake and reported its receipt during treatment. “Percentage of needs matched” indicates the proportion of five service domains (medical, mental health, family, vocational and housing) so matched. Findings In mixed regression models controlling for multiple factors, a greater percentage of needs matched tended to improve primary ($\beta$ = 0.028, P = 0.09) and overall ($\beta$ = 0.049, P = 0.05) drug use in the follow-up year. Exclusion of treatment duration as a covariate doubled the magnitude of these coefficients. The benefits of matching were concentrated among the half of patients reporting needs in four to five rather than one to three domains, and were strongest among patients in long-term residential facilities. Addressing vocational and housing needs exerted the greatest effects. Conclusions Matching comprehensive services to needs is a useful addiction treatment practice, especially for high-need patients.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Substance abuse treatment entry, retention, and outcome in women: A review of the literature;,citation_abstract=This paper reviews the literature examining characteristics associated with treatment outcome in women with substance use disorders. A search of the English language literature from 1975 to 2005 using Medline and PsycInfo databases found 280 relevant articles. Ninety percent of the studies investigating gender differences in substance abuse treatment outcomes were published since 1990, and of those, over 40% were published since the year 2000. Only 11.8% of these studies were randomized clinical trials. A convergence of evidence suggests that women with substance use disorders are less likely, over the lifetime, to enter treatment compared to their male counterparts. Once in treatment, however, gender is not a significant predictor of treatment retention, completion, or outcome. Gender-specific predictors of outcome do exist, however, and individual characteristics and treatment approaches can differentially affect outcomes by gender. While women-only treatment is not necessarily more effective than mixed-gender treatment, some greater effectiveness has been demonstrated by treatments that address problems more common to substance-abusing women or that are designed for specific subgroups of this population. There is a need to develop and test effective treatments for specific subgroups such as older women with substance use disorders, as well as those with co-occurring substance use and psychiatric disorders such as eating disorders. Future research on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of gender-specific versus standard treatments, as well as identification of the characteristics of women and men who can benefit from mixed-gender versus single-gender treatments, would advance the field.;,citation_author=Shelly F.

Methods The authors used 13 electronic databases and manually searched the literature from January 1, 1978, to May 30, 2013. One hundred (69%) of 145 primary research articles met the inclusion criteria. Two blinded, independent reviewers scored each article. Consensus discussions and a content expert reconciled discrepancies. Results Current rates of alcohol and substance abuse among Latinos are comparable to or surpass other U.S. ethnic groups. Disparities in access and quality of care are evident between Latinos and other ethnic groups. As a heterogeneous group, Latinos vary by geographic region in terms of substance of choice and their cultural identity takes precedence over general ethnic identity as a likely determinant of substance abuse behaviors. There is growing research interest in systems influencing treatment access and adherence among racial/ethnic and gender minority groups. However, studies on Latinos’ service use and immediate treatment outcomes have been both limited in number and inconsistent in findings. Conclusions This review identified human capital, quality of care, and access to culturally responsive care as key strategies to eliminate disparities in health and treatment quality. Implications are discussed, including the need for effectiveness studies on Latinos served by systems of care that, under health care reform, are seeking to maximize resources, improve outcomes, and reduce variation in quality of care.;,citation_author=Erick G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A smartphone application to support recovery from alcoholism: A randomized clinical trial;,citation_abstract=IMPORTANCE: Patients leaving residential treatment for alcohol use disorders are not typically offered evidence-based continuing care, although research suggests that continuing care is associated with better outcomes. A smartphone-based application could provide effective continuing care. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients leaving residential treatment for alcohol use disorders with a smartphone application to support recovery have fewer risky drinking days than control patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An unmasked randomized clinical trial involving 3 residential programs operated by 1 nonprofit treatment organization in the Midwestern United States and 2 residential programs operated by 1 nonprofit organization in the Northeastern United States. In total, 349 patients who met the criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence when they entered residential treatment were randomized to treatment as usual (n = 179) or treatment as usual plus a smartphone (n = 170) with the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS), an application designed to improve continuing care for alcohol use disorders. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment as usual varied across programs; none offered patients coordinated continuing care after discharge. A-CHESS provides monitoring, information, communication, and support services to patients, including ways for patients and counselors to stay in contact. The intervention and follow-up period lasted 8 and 4 months, respectively. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risky drinking days–the number of days during which a patient’s drinking in a 2-hour period exceeded 4 standard drinks for men and 3 standard drinks for women, with standard drink defined as one that contains roughly 14 g of pure alcohol (12 oz of regular beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz of distilled spirits). Patients were asked to report their risky drinking days in the previous 30 days on surveys taken 4, 8, and 12 months after discharge from residential treatment. RESULTS: For the 8 months of the intervention and 4 months of follow-up, patients in the A-CHESS group reported significantly fewer risky drinking days than did patients in the control group, with a mean of 1.39 vs 2.75 days (mean difference, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.46-2.27; P = .003). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that a multifeatured smartphone application may have significant benefit to patients in continuing care for alcohol use disorders.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Activity identification from GPS trajectories using spatial temporal POIs’ attractiveness;,citation_abstract=GPS (Globe Positioning System) trajectory data provide a new way for city travel analysis others than traditional travel diary data. But generally raw GPS traces do not include information on trip purposes or activities. Earlier studies addressed this issue through a combination of manual and computer-assisted data processing steps. Nevertheless, geographic context databases provide the possibility for automatic activity identification based on GPS trajectories since each activity is uniquely defined by a set of features such as location and duration. Distinguished with most existing methods using two dimensional factors, this paper presents a novel approach using spatial temporal attractiveness of POIs (Point of Interests) to identify activity-locations as well as durations from raw GPS trajectory. We also introduce an algorithm to figure out how the intersections of trajectories and spatial-temporal attractiveness prisms indicate the potential possibilities for activities. Finally, Experiments using real world GPS tracking data, road networks and POIs are conducted for evaluations of the proposed approach.;,citation_author=Lian Huang;,citation_author=Qingquan Li;,citation_author=Yang Yue;,citation_publication_date=2010-11;,citation_cover_date=2010-11;,citation_year=2010;,citation_doi=10.1145/1867699.1867704;,citation_isbn=978-1-4503-0434-4;,citation_conference_title=Proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Location Based Social Networks;,citation_conference=Association for Computing Machinery;,citation_series_title=LBSN ’10;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Receiving addiction treatment in the US: Do patient demographics, drug of choice, or substance use disorder severity matter?;,citation_abstract=Background Understanding addiction treatment needs and utilization is important to health systems and government to develop policies that effectively address substance use disorders (SUDs) at a population level. This study aims to describe differences in treatment receipt by diagnostic category, drug of choice, and demographic characteristics in an effort to identify potential disparities in receipt of care. Methods Using data from the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, we calculated the proportion of various groups that received treatment and conducted binary logistic regression to determine the association between addiction treatment receipt and SUD severity, drug of choice, and patient demographics. Results Using DSM-5, 16.7 million Americans (age 12 and older) are estimated to have a mild SUD, 5.2 million a moderate SUD, and 4.6 million a severe SUD. The two greatest predictors of treatment receipt are addiction severity and probation status. People with severe opioid use disorder have the greatest probability of treatment receipt with a 55.6% predicted probability of receiving treatment, while people with a mild alcohol use disorder are the least likely to receive treatment with a predicted probability of 1.8% receiving treatment. People with mild alcohol use disorder make up the largest proportion of people identified as needing but not receiving treatment when assuming all people with a diagnosis need treatment. Conclusions Improving use of existing specialty addiction treatment capacity to address the needs of the 8.5 million Americans with moderate or severe SUD and better use of the general health care system to treat mild or stable SUD may be a better focus for health system planners and government than adding new capacity for specialty treatment.;,citation_author=Kimberly Johnson;,citation_author=Khary K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Compliance with ecological momentary assessment protocols in substance users: A meta-analysis;,citation_abstract=Background and Aims While there are considerable benefits to Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), poor compliance with assessment protocols has been identified as a limitation, particularly in substance users. Our aim was to identify the pooled compliance rate of EMA studies in substance users and examine variables that may influence compliance with EMA protocols, such as the length and frequency of assessments. Design A meta-analysis and meta-regression of all possible studies (randomized controlled trials and longitudinal) which incorporated EMA protocols, examining substance use. Setting Studies took place from 1998 to 2017, in numerous countries world-wide. Participants One hundred and twenty-six studies were identified, contributing a total of 19&nbsp;431 participants (52.32% male, mean age&nbsp;=&nbsp;28.86). Measurements Compliance data, the proportion of responses to the study protocol, were extracted from each study alongside prompt frequency, total length of assessment period, substance use population and device used to administer EMA prompts. Findings The pooled compliance rate across all studies was 75.06% [95% confidence interval (CI)&nbsp;=&nbsp;72.37%, 77.65%]. There was no evidence that compliance rates were significantly associated with prompt frequency [Q(3) = 7.35, P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.061], length of assessment period [Q(2) = 2.40, P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.301], substance type [Q(3) = 6.30, P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.098] or device administration [Q(4) = 4.28, P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.369].

It is not known how often commercially insured adults obtain follow-up treatment after nonfatal opioid overdose.To investigate the incidence of follow-up treatment following emergency department discharge after nonfatal opioid overdose and patient characteristics associated with receipt of follow-up treatment.A retrospective cohort study was conducted using an administrative claims database for a large US commercial insurer, from October 1, 2011, to September 30, 2016. Data analysis was performed from May 1, 2019, to September 26, 2019. Adult patients discharged from the emergency department after an index opioid overdose (no overdose in the preceding 90 days) were included. Patients with cancer and without continuous insurance enrollment were excluded.The primary outcome was follow-up treatment in the 90 days following overdose, defined as a combined outcome of claims for treatment encounters or medications for opioid use disorder (buprenorphine and naltrexone). Analysis was stratified by whether patients received treatment for opioid use disorder in the 90 days before the overdose. Logistic regression models were used to identify patient characteristics associated with receipt of follow-up treatment. Marginal effects were used to report the average adjusted probability and absolute risk differences (ARDs) in follow-up for different patient characteristics.A total of 6451 patients were identified with nonfatal opioid overdose; the mean (SD) age was 45.0 (19.3) years, 3267 were women (50.6%), and 4676 patients (72.5%) reported their race as non-Hispanic white. A total of 1069 patients (16.6%; 95% CI, 15.7%-17.5%) obtained follow-up treatment within 90 days after the overdose. In adjusted analysis of patients who did not receive treatment before the overdose, black patients were half as likely to obtain follow-up compared with non-Hispanic white patients (ARD, -5.9%; 95% CI, -8.6% to -3.6%). Women (ARD, -1.7%; 95% CI, -3.3% to -0.5%) and Hispanic patients (ARD, -3.5%; 95% CI, -6.1% to -0.9%) were also less likely to obtain follow-up. For each additional year of age, patients were 0.2% less likely to obtain follow-up (95% CI, -0.3% to -0.1%).Efforts to improve the low rate of timely follow-up treatment following opioid overdose may seek to address sex, race/ethnicity, and age disparities.;,citation_author=Austin S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Personalized Treatment of Alcohol Dependence;,citation_abstract=Pharmacogenetic and adaptive treatment approaches can be used to personalize care for alcohol-dependent patients. Preliminary evidence shows that variation in the gene encoding the $\mu$-opioid receptor moderates the response to naltrexone when used to treat alcohol dependence. Studies have also shown moderating effects of variation in the gene encoding the serotonin transporter on response to serotonergic treatment of alcohol dependence. Adaptive algorithms that modify alcohol treatment based on patients’ progress have also shown promise. Initial response to outpatient treatment appears to be a particularly important in the selection of optimal continuing care interventions. In addition, stepped-care algorithms can reduce the cost and burden of treatment while maintaining good outcomes. Finally, matching treatment to specific problems present at intake or that emerge during treatment can also improve outcomes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Beyond sigmoids: How to obtain well-calibrated probabilities from binary classifiers with beta calibration;,citation_abstract=For optimal decision making under variable class distributions and misclassification costs a classifier needs to produce well-calibrated estimates of the posterior probability. Isotonic calibration is a powerful non-parametric method that is however prone to overfitting on smaller datasets; hence a parametric method based on the logistic sigmoidal curve is commonly used. While logistic calibration is designed for normally distributed per-class scores, we demonstrate experimentally that many classifiers including Naive Bayes and Adaboost suffer from a particular distortion where these score distributions are heavily skewed. In such cases logistic calibration can easily yield probability estimates that are worse than the original scores. Moreover, the logistic curve family does not include the identity function, and hence logistic calibration can easily uncalibrate a perfectly calibrated classifier. In this paper we solve all these problems with a richer class of parametric calibration maps based on the beta distribution. We derive the method from first principles and show that fitting it is as easy as fitting a logistic curve. Extensive experiments show that beta calibration is superior to logistic calibration for a wide range of classifiers: Naive Bayes, Adaboost, random forest, logistic regression, support vector machine and multi-layer perceptron. If the original classifier is already calibrated, then beta calibration learns a function close to the identity. On this we build a statistical test to recognise if the model deviates from being well-calibrated.;,citation_author=Meelis Kull;,citation_author=Telmo M.

Methods: The authors applied a Bayesian spatial regression technique to investigate the association between U.S. county-level characteristics and drug, alcohol, and suicide mortality rates for 2004–2016, accounting for spatial correlation that occurs among counties. Results: Mortality risks from drug, alcohol, and suicide were positively associated with the degree of rurality, the proportion of vacant housing units, the population with a disability, the unemployed population, the population with low access to grocery stores, and the population with no health insurance. Conversely, risks were negatively associated with Hispanic population, non-Hispanic Black population, and population with a bachelor’s degree or higher. Conclusions: Spatial disparities in drug, alcohol, and suicide mortality exist at the county level across the U.S. social determinants of health; educational attainment, degree of rurality, ethnicity, disability, unemployment, and health insurance status are important factors associated with these mortality rates. A comprehensive strategy that includes downstream interventions providing equitable access to healthcare services and upstream efforts in addressing socioeconomic conditions is warranted to effectively reduce these mortality burdens.;,citation_author=Jong Hyung Lee;,citation_author=David C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A systematic review of rural-specific barriers to medication treatment for opioid use disorder in the United States;,citation_abstract=Opioid-related deaths have risen dramatically in rural communities. Prior studies highlight few medication treatment providers for opioid use disorder in rural communities, though literature has yet to examine rural-specific treatment barriers. We conducted a systematic review to highlight the state of knowledge around rural medication treatment for opioid use disorder, identify consumer- and provider-focused treatment barriers, and discuss rural-specific implications. We systematically reviewed the literature using PsycINFO, Web of Science, and PubMed databases (January 2018). Articles meeting inclusion criteria involved rural samples or urban/rural comparisons targeting outpatient medication treatment for opioid use disorder, and were conducted in the U.S. to minimize healthcare differences. Our analysis categorized consumer- and/or provider-focused barriers, and coded barriers as related to treatment availability, accessibility, and/or acceptability. Eighteen articles met inclusion, 15 which addressed consumer-focused barriers, while seven articles reported provider-focused barriers. Availability barriers were most commonly reported across consumer (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;10) and provider (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;5) studies, and included the lack of clinics/providers, backup, and resources. Acceptability barriers, described in three consumer and five provider studies, identified negative provider attitudes about addiction treatment, and providers’ perceptions of treatment as unsatisfactory for rural patients. Finally, accessibility barriers related to travel and cost were detailed in four consumer-focused studies whereas two provider-focused studies identified time constraints. Our findings consistently identified a lack of medication providers and rural-specific implementation challenges. This review highlights a lack of rural-focused studies involving consumer participants, treatment outcomes, or barriers impacting underserved populations.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A unified approach to interpreting model predictions;,citation_abstract=Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction’s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties.

Biological sex differences are evident across an array of systems, including brain structure and function, endocrine function, and metabolic function. Gender (i.e., environmentally and socioculturally defined roles for men and women) also contributes to the initiation and course of substance use and SUDs. Adverse medical, psychiatric, and functional consequences associated with SUDs are often more severe in women. However, men and women do not substantively differ with respect to SUD treatment outcomes. Although several trends are beginning to emerge in the literature, findings on sex and gender differences in SUDs are complicated by the interacting contributions of biological and environmental factors.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Treatment use, sources of payment, and financial barriers to treatment among individuals with opioid use disorder following the national implementation of the ACA;,citation_abstract=Introduction Despite increasing rates of opioid misuse and hospitalizations, rates of treatment for those with opioid use disorder (OUD) are very low. This study examined the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) insurance expansion on improving rates of insurance, health care access, and treatment for those with OUD. Methods Data on individuals ages 18–64 with OUD come from the 2008–2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N=4100). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the trends of health care insurance, treatment and barriers to care across the stages of ACA implementation: pre-ACA (2008–2009), partial-ACA (2010–2013), and national implementation (2014). All models were adjusted for predisposing, enabling, and need factors. Results In both adjusted and unadjusted comparisons, national implementation of the ACA was associated with significant improvements in outcome measures for those with OUD. Multivariable analyses indicate that, after national implementation, those with OUD were significantly less likely to be uninsured and were less likely to report financial barriers as a reason for not receiving substance use treatment, relative to the pre-ACA period. Individuals were also more likely to receive substance use treatment and were more likely to report that insurance paid for treatment after national implementation of the ACA relative to the pre-ACA period. These results persisted when national implementation was compared relative to partial-implementation. Conclusions National implementation of the ACA has helped to reduce rates of uninsurance, barriers to care, and improve rates of substance use treatment for those with OUD.;,citation_author=Ryan M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Drug dependence, a chronic medical illness: Implications for treatment, insurance, and outcomes evaluation;,citation_abstract=The effects of drug dependence on social systems has helped shape the generally held view that drug dependence is primarily a social problem, not a health problem. In turn, medical approaches to prevention and treatment are lacking. We examined evidence that drug (including alcohol) dependence is a chronic medical illness. A literature review compared the diagnoses, heritability, etiology (genetic and environmental factors), pathophysiology, and response to treatments (adherence and relapse) of drug dependence vs type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma. Genetic heritability, personal choice, and environmental factors are comparably involved in the etiology and course of all of these disorders. Drug dependence produces significant and lasting changes in brain chemistry and function. Effective medications are available for treating nicotine, alcohol, and opiate dependence but not stimulant or marijuana dependence. Medication adherence and relapse rates are similar across these illnesses. Drug dependence generally has been treated as if it were an acute illness. Review results suggest that long-term care strategies of medication management and continued monitoring produce lasting benefits. Drug dependence should be insured, treated, and evaluated like other chronic illnesses. JAMA. 2000;284:1689-1695.;,citation_author=A. T. McLellan;,citation_author=D. C. Lewis;,citation_author=C. P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The intersection of gender and drug use-related stigma: A mixed methods systematic review and synthesis of the literature;,citation_abstract=Background Substance use-related stigma is a significant barrier to care among persons who use drugs (PWUD). Less is known regarding how intersectional identities, like gender, shape experiences of substance use-related stigma. We sought to answer the following question: Do men or women PWUD experience more drug use stigma? Methods Data were drawn from a systematic review of the global, peer-reviewed scientific literature on substance use-related stigma conducted through 2017 and guided by the Stigma and Substance Use Process Model and PRISMA guidelines. Articles were included in the present analysis if they either qualitatively illustrated themes related to the gendered nature of drug use-related stigma, or quantitatively tested the moderating effect of gender on drug use-related stigma. Results Of the 75 studies included, 40 (53 %) were quantitative and 35 (47 %) were qualitative. Of the quantitative articles, 22 (55 %) found no association between gender and drug use-related stigma, 4 (10 %) identified women who use drugs (WWUD) were more stigmatized, and 2 (5 %) determined men who use drugs (MWUD) were more stigmatized. In contrast, nearly all (34; 97 %) of the qualitative articles demonstrated WWUD experienced greater levels of drug use-related stigma. Conclusion The quantitative literature is equivocal regarding the influence of gender on drug use-related stigma, but the qualitative literature more clearly demonstrates WWUD experience greater levels of stigma. The use of validated drug use-related stigma measures and the tailoring of stigma scales to WWUD are needed to understand the role of stigma in heightening the disproportionate harms experienced by WWUD.;,citation_author=S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Model Cards for Model Reporting;,citation_abstract=Trained machine learning models are increasingly used to perform high-impact tasks in areas such as law enforcement, medicine, education, and employment. In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type [15]) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related artificial intelligence technology, increasing transparency into how well artificial intelligence technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.;,citation_author=Margaret Mitchell;,citation_author=Simone Wu;,citation_author=Andrew Zaldivar;,citation_author=Parker Barnes;,citation_author=Lucy Vasserman;,citation_author=Ben Hutchinson;,citation_author=Elena Spitzer;,citation_author=Inioluwa Deborah Raji;,citation_author=Timnit Gebru;,citation_publication_date=2019-01;,citation_cover_date=2019-01;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993;,citation_doi=10.1145/3287560.3287596;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_conference_title=Proceedings of the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prospective Prediction of Lapses in Opioid Use Disorder: Protocol for a Personal Sensing Study;,citation_abstract=Background: Successful long-term recovery from opioid use disorder (OUD) requires continuous lapse risk monitoring and appropriate use and adaptation of recovery-supportive behaviors as lapse risk changes. Available treatments often fail to support long-term recovery by failing to account for the dynamic nature of long-term recovery. Objective: The aim of this protocol paper is to describe research that aims to develop a highly contextualized lapse risk prediction model that forecasts the ongoing probability of lapse. Methods: The participants will include 480 US adults in their first year of recovery from OUD. Participants will report lapses and provide data relevant to lapse risk for a year with a digital therapeutic smartphone app through both self-report and passive personal sensing methods (eg, cellular communications and geolocation). The lapse risk prediction model will be developed using contemporary rigorous machine learning methods that optimize prediction in new data.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Building health behavior models to guide the development of just-in-time adaptive interventions: A pragmatic framework;,citation_abstract=Advances in wireless devices and mobile technology offer many opportunities for delivering just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs)–suites of interventions that adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and circumstances with the goal to address the individual’s need for support, whenever this need arises. A major challenge confronting behavioral scientists aiming to develop a JITAI concerns the selection and integration of existing empirical, theoretical and practical evidence into a scientific model that can inform the construction of a JITAI and help identify scientific gaps. The purpose of this paper is to establish a pragmatic framework that can be used to organize existing evidence into a useful model for JITAI construction. This framework involves clarifying the conceptual purpose of a JITAI, namely the provision of just-in-time support via adaptation, as well as describing the components of a JITAI and articulating a list of concrete questions to guide the establishment of a useful model for JITAI construction. The proposed framework includes an organizing scheme for translating the relatively static scientific models underlying many health behavior interventions into a more dynamic model that better incorporates the element of time. This framework will help to guide the next generation of empirical work to support the creation of effective JITAIs.;,citation_author=Inbal Nahum-Shani;,citation_author=Eric B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) in Mobile Health: Key Components and Design Principles for Ongoing Health Behavior Support;,citation_abstract=Background: The just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) is an intervention design aiming to provide the right type/amount of support, at the right time, by adapting to an individual’s changing internal and contextual state. The availability of increasingly powerful mobile and sensing technologies underpins the use of JITAIs to support health behavior, as in such a setting an individual’s state can change rapidly, unexpectedly, and in his/her natural environment. Purpose: Despite the increasing use and appeal of JITAIs, a major gap exists between the growing technological capabilities for delivering JITAIs and research on the development and evaluation of these interventions. Many JITAIs have been developed with minimal use of empirical evidence, theory, or accepted treatment guidelines. Here, we take an essential first step towards bridging this gap. Methods: Building on health behavior theories and the extant literature on JITAIs, we clarify the scientific motivation for JITAIs, define their fundamental components, and highlight design principles related to these components. Examples of JITAIs from various domains of health behavior research are used for illustration. Conclusions: As we enter a new era of technological capacity for delivering JITAIs, it is critical that researchers develop sophisticated and nuanced health behavior theories capable of guiding the construction of such interventions. Particular attention has to be given to better understanding the implications of providing timely and ecologically sound support for intervention adherence and retention.;,citation_author=Inbal Nahum-Shani;,citation_author=Shawna N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Healthcare coverage and service access for low-income adults with substance use disorders;,citation_abstract=Introduction Although health coverage facilitates service access to adults in the general population, uncertainty exists over the extent to which this relationship extends to low-income adults with substance use disorders. Methods The health status and service use patterns of low-income adults with substance use disorders who had continuous, discontinuous, and no past year health coverage were compared using data from the 2015–2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). The NSDUH is a nationally representative survey of the civilian non-institutionalized population. Results In the weighted sample (unweighted n&nbsp;=&nbsp;9243), approximately 65.66% of low-income adults with substance use disorders had continuous coverage, 17.03% had discontinuous coverage, and 17.31% had no insurance coverage during the past year. Although few group differences were observed in self-reported health status, the uninsured group compared to the discontinously and continuously covered groups, respectively, was less likely to report a past year substance use treatment visit (11.03% vs. 14.83% vs. 15.61%), an outpatient care visit (53.39% vs. 71.27% vs. 79.04%), an emergency department visit (33.33% vs. 45.76% vs. 45.57%), or an inpatient admission (9.24% vs. 15.11% vs. 15.58%). Conclusions Although the cross sectional design limits causal inferences, the correlations between lacking health insurance and low rates of substance use treatment and healthcare use raise the possibility that increasing healthcare coverage might increase access to substance use treatment and other needed healthcare services for low-income adults with substance use disorders.;,citation_author=Mark Olfson;,citation_author=Christine Mauro;,citation_author=Melanie M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An exploratory study of sex and gender differences in demographic, psychosocial, clinical, and substance use treatment characteristics of patients in outpatient opioid use disorder treatment with buprenorphine;,citation_abstract=As treatment expansion in the opioid epidemic continues, it is important to examine how the makeup of individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) is evolving. Treatment programs are increasingly utilizing buprenorphine, an effective OUD medication. This exploratory study examines sex and gender differences in psychosocial, clinical, and substance use treatment characteristics of a clinical population in outpatient medication treatment for OUD with buprenorphine. This is a secondary data analysis from a cross-sectional survey study with retrospective medical record review conducted with patients recruited from an office-based opioid treatment clinic between July–September 2019. Participants on buprenorphine for at least 28 days at time of survey completion were included (n = 133). Differences between men and women were explored with Pearson $\chi^2$ and Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables and T-tests for continuous variables. The sample was 55.6% women and nearly three fourths Black (70.7%). Mean days in current treatment episode was 431.6 (SD = 244.82). Women were younger and more likely to be unemployed, identify as a sexual minority, and live alone with children than men. More women than men had a psychiatric comorbidity. Women reported more prescription opioid misuse while men had more heroin only opioid use. More men reported comorbid alcohol use and a history of drug overdose. One third of participants reported recent discrimination in a health care setting due to substance use. As buprenorphine-based outpatient treatment programs continue to expand, present study findings support evaluation of the unique needs of men and women in order to better tailor OUD-related services and improve treatment outcomes.

Methods Data were pooled from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health survey years 2015, 2016, and 2017. Analyses were limited to adult White, Black, and Latino participants who met DSM-IV criteria for a past-year substance use disorder (n = 12,070). Hierarchical multivariate logistic regression models examined the role of race/ethnicity on past-year use of (1) any substance abuse treatment services and (2) specialty treatment. Important covariates included socio-demographics, problem severity, and perceived treatment need. A sub-analysis was also conducted that was limited to participants who reported having health insurance to explore the role of insurance status on treatment utilization by race/ethnicity. Results Findings showed that Latinos and Blacks significantly underutilized specialty treatment relative to Whites. These relationships were statistically significant after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, problem severity, and perceived treatment need. However, when analyses were limited to only those with health insurance, Black-White disparities became non-significant, while Latino-White disparities persisted.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Idiographic Lapse Prediction With State Space Modeling: Algorithm Development and Validation Study;,citation_abstract=Background: Many mental health conditions (eg, substance use or panic disorders) involve long-term patient assessment and treatment. Growing evidence suggests that the progression and presentation of these conditions may be highly individualized. Digital sensing and predictive modeling can augment scarce clinician resources to expand and personalize patient care. We discuss techniques to process patient data into risk predictions, for instance, the lapse risk for a patient with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Of particular interest are idiographic approaches that fit personalized models to each patient. Objective: This study bridges 2 active research areas in mental health: risk prediction and time-series idiographic modeling. Existing work in risk prediction has focused on machine learning (ML) classifier approaches, typically trained at the population level. In contrast, psychological explanatory modeling has relied on idiographic time-series techniques. We propose state space modeling, an idiographic time-series modeling framework, as an alternative to ML classifiers for patient risk prediction. Methods: We used a 3-month observational study of participants (N=148) in early recovery from AUD. Using once-daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA), we trained idiographic state space models (SSMs) and compared their predictive performance to logistic regression and gradient-boosted ML classifiers. Performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for 3 prediction tasks: same-day lapse, lapse within 3 days, and lapse within 7 days. To mimic real-world use, we evaluated changes in AUROC when models were given access to increasing amounts of a participant’s EMA data (15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 days). We used Bayesian hierarchical modeling to compare SSMs to the benchmark ML techniques, specifically analyzing posterior estimates of mean model AUROC. Results: Posterior estimates strongly suggested that SSMs had the best mean AUROC performance in all 3 prediction tasks with $\geq$30 days of participant EMA data. With 15 days of data, results varied by task. Median posterior probabilities that SSMs had the best performance with $\geq$30 days of participant data for same-day lapse, lapse within 3 days, and lapse within 7 days were 0.997 (IQR 0.877-0.999), 0.999 (IQR 0.992-0.999), and 0.998 (IQR 0.955-0.999), respectively. With 15 days of data, these median posterior probabilities were 0.732, &amp;amp;amp;lt;0.001, and &amp;lt;0.001, respectively. Conclusions: The study findings suggest that SSMs may be a compelling alternative to traditional ML approaches for risk prediction. SSMs support idiographic model fitting, even for rare outcomes, and can offer better predictive performance than existing ML approaches. Further, SSMs estimate a model for a patient’s time-series behavior, making them ideal for stepping beyond risk prediction to frameworks for optimal treatment selection (eg, administered using a digital therapeutic platform). Although AUD was used as a case study, this SSM framework can be readily applied to risk prediction tasks for other mental health conditions.;,citation_author=Eric Pulick;,citation_author=John Curtin;,citation_author=Yonatan Mintz;,citation_publication_date=2025-06;,citation_cover_date=2025-06;,citation_year=2025;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.2196/73265;,citation_volume=9;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=JMIR Formative Research;,citation_publisher=JMIR Publications Inc., Toronto, Canada;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An intensive outpatient approach for cocaine abuse treatment. The Matrix model;,citation_abstract=The Matrix model of outpatient treatment was developed during the 1980s in response to an overwhelming demand for cocaine abuse treatment services. The model was constructed using components based upon empirically supported findings from the substance abuse research field. Over the course of development, data were collected on the treatment model and the model was modified based upon empirical evaluation. A pilot study comparing the Matrix outpatient model with an inpatient hospital treatment program produced preliminary support for the clinical utility of the model. An open trial comparing publicly and privately funded patients demonstrated that patients with fewer resources were more difficult to engage and retain in this model of outpatient treatment. In a controlled trial, a clear positive relationship was documented between duration and amount of treatment involvement in the Matrix model and positive outcome at 1 year. Due to a variety of methodological issues, the study was not able to answer definitively the question of clinical efficacy. In all of these studies, patients treated with the Matrix model demonstrated statistically significant reductions in drug and alcohol use and improvements in psychological indicators.

The application of person-specific analyses to intensive repeated measurement data can assess some aspects of persons that are distinct from the valuable results obtained from single-occasion assessments. Guided by interpersonal theory, we assess a psychotherapy patient’s interpersonal processes as they unfold in his daily life. We highlight specific contexts that change these processes, use an informant report to examine discrepancies in his reported interpersonal processes, and examine how his interpersonal processes differ as a function of varying levels of self-esteem and anger.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Ethnic disparities in clinical severity and services for alcohol problems: Results from the National Alcohol Survey;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: This study reports lifetime estimates of the extent of unmet need for alcohol services across the 3 largest ethnic groups in America, and examines factors that may contribute to ethnic differences in service use. Prior studies report mixed findings as to the existence of ethnic disparities in alcohol services, with some suggesting that minorities are over-represented in treatment settings. METHODS: Drawing on the most recent National Alcohol Surveys, we compare rates and factors associated with the lifetime service use for alcohol problems among Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics who meet lifetime criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence. RESULTS: While bivariate analyses revealed few ethnic differences in service use, there were significant differences by ethnicity in multivariate models that included alcohol problem severity and its interactions with ethnicity. At higher levels of problem severity, both Hispanics and Blacks were less likely to have utilized services than comparable Whites. Hispanics, on the whole, reported higher-severity alcohol problems than Whites. Yet, they were less likely to have received specialty treatment and multiple types of alcohol services, and were more likely to cite economic and logistical barriers as reasons for not obtaining care. CONCLUSIONS: Future efforts to study ethnic disparities in alcohol services should utilize analytic approaches that address potential confounding between ethnicity and other factors in service use, such as alcohol problem severity. Our findings suggest that Hispanics and Blacks with higher-severity alcohol problems may utilize services at lower rates than comparable Whites, and that, particularly for Hispanics, this may in part be attributable to financial and logistical barriers to care.;,citation_author=Laura A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pooled and person-specific machine learning models for predicting future alcohol consumption, craving, and wanting to drink: A demonstration of parallel utility;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The specific factors driving alcohol consumption, craving, and wanting to drink, are likely different for different people. The present study sought to apply statistical classification methods to idiographic time series data in order to identify person-specific predictors of future drinking-relevant behavior, affect, and cognitions in a college student sample. DESIGN: Participants were sent 8 mobile phone surveys per day for 15 days. Each survey assessed the number of drinks consumed since the previous survey, as well as positive affect, negative affect, alcohol craving, drinking expectancies, perceived alcohol consumption norms, impulsivity, and social and situational context. Each individual’s data were split into training and testing sets, so that trained models could be validated using person-specific out-of-sample data. Elastic net regularization was used to select a subset of a set of 40 variables to be used to predict either alcohol consumption, craving, or wanting to drink, forward in time. SETTING: A west-coast university. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three university students who had consumed alcohol in their lifetime. MEASUREMENTS: Mobile phone surveys. FINDINGS: Averaging across participants, accurate out-of-sample predictions of future drinking were made 76% of the time. For craving, the mean out-of-sample R$^2$ value was .27. For wanting to drink, the mean out-of-sample R$^2$ value was .27. CONCLUSION: Using a person-specific constellation of psychosocial and temporal variables, it may be possible to accurately predict drinking behavior, affect, and cognitions before they occur.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Targeting the Barriers in the Substance Use Disorder Continuum of Care With Peer Recovery Support;,citation_abstract=Substance Use Disorder (SUD) has been recognized as a chronic, relapsing disorder. However, much of existing SUD care remains based in an acute care model that focuses on clinical stabilization and discharge, failing to address the longer-term needs of people in recovery from addiction. The high rates of client’s disengagement and attrition across the continuum of care highlight the need to identify and overcome the obstacles that people face at each stage of the treatment and recovery process. Peer recovery support services (PRSS) show promise in helping people initiate, pursue, and sustain long-term recovery from substance-related problems. Based on a comprehensive review of the literature, the goal of this article is to explore the possible roles of peers along the SUD care continuum and their potential to improve engagement in care by targeting specific barriers that prevent people from successfully transitioning from one stage to the next leading eventually to full recovery. A multidimensional framework of SUD care continuum was developed based on the adapted model of opioid use disorder cascade of care and recovery stages, within which the barriers known to be associated with each stage of the continuum were matched with the existing evidence of effectiveness of specific PRSSs. With this conceptual paper, we are hoping to show how PRSSs can become a complementary and integrated part of the system of care, which is an essential step toward improving the continuity of care and health outcomes.;,citation_author=Milena Stanojlović;,citation_author=Larry Davidson;,citation_publication_date=2021-01;,citation_cover_date=2021-01;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.1177/1178221820976988;,citation_issn=1178-2218;,citation_volume=15;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Substance Abuse: Research and Treatment;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd STM;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Facing Addiction in America: The Surgeon General’s Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health;,citation_abstract=This Surgeon General’s Report has been created because of the important health and social problems associated with alcohol and drug misuse in America. As described in this Report, a comprehensive approach is needed to address substance use problems in the United States that includes several key components: Enhanced public education to improve awareness about substance use problems and demand for more effective policies and practices to address them; Widespread implementation of evidence-based prevention policies and programs to prevent substance misuse and related harms; Improved access to evidence-based treatment services, integrated with mainstream health care, for those at risk for or affected by substance use disorders; Recovery support services (RSS) to assist individuals in maintaining remission and preventing relapse; and Research-informed public policies and financing strategies to ensure that substance misuse and use disorder services are accessible, compassionate, efficient, and sustainable. Recognizing these needs, the Report explains the neurobiological basis for substance use disorders and provides the biological, psychological, and social frameworks for improving diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of alcohol and drug misuse. It also describes evidence-based prevention strategies, such as public policies that can reduce substance misuse problems (e.g., driving under the influence [DUI]); effective treatment strategies, including medications and behavioral therapies for treating substance use disorders; and RSS for people who have completed treatment. Additionally, the Report describes recent changes in health care financing, including changes in health insurance regulations, which support the integration of clinical prevention and treatment services for substance use disorders into mainstream health care practice, and defines a research agenda for addressing alcohol and drug misuse as medical conditions. Thus, this first Surgeon General’s Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health is not issued simply because of the prevalence of substance misuse or even the related devastating harms and costs, but also to help inform policymakers, health care professionals, and the general public about effective, practical, and sustainable strategies to address these problems. These strategies have the potential to substantially reduce substance misuse and related problems; promote early intervention for substance misuse and substance use disorders; and improve the availability of high-quality treatment and RSS for persons with substance use disorders.;,citation_author=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (US);,citation_author=Office of the Surgeon General (US);,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_pmid=28252892;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_series_title=Reports of the Surgeon General;">

This study examined disparities in the ways in which male and female alcoholics have been studied in the treatment outcome literature and examined the role of sex bias (author sex) as a contributing factor. Two hundred fifty-nine studies published between 1972 and 1980 were reviewed that reported drinking-related outcome of subjects treated with psychological intervention or medication. Only 7.8% of subjects sampled in these studies were women. Of greater interest, female authors sampled nearly 3 times as many women in proportion to the number of people they studied as did male authors; women subjects were more than one and one-half times as likely to be followed up by female than by male authors; and 3 times as many female as male authors presented data examining sex differences. The same kind of differences between male and female authors occurred with respect to specifying precise numbers of male and female subjects studied and followed up, and with respect to examining prognostic variables related to women’ outcome.

We provide a brief outline of precautions that intervention developers and implementers can take to guard against creating or worsening inequality through health informatics.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Gender differences in alcohol and substance use relapse;,citation_abstract=This review explores gender differences in relapse and characteristics of relapse events in alcohol and substance use. For alcohol, relapse rates were similar across gender. Although negative mood, childhood sexual abuse, alcohol-related self-efficacy, and poorer coping strategies predicted alcohol relapse, gender did not moderate these effects. Gender did moderate the association between marriage and alcohol relapse. For women, marriage and marital stress were risk factors for alcohol relapse; among men, marriage lowered relapse risk. This gender difference in the role of marriage in relapse may be a result of partner differences in problem drinking. Alcoholic women are more likely to be married to heavy drinking partners than are alcoholic men; thus, alcoholic women may be put at risk of relapse by marriage and alcoholic men may be protected by marriage. There are fewer studies documenting gender differences in substance abuse relapse so conclusions are limited and tentative. In contrast to the lack of gender differences in alcohol relapse rates, women appear less likely to experience relapse to substance use, relative to men. Women relapsing to substance use appear to be more sensitive to negative affect and interpersonal problems. Men, in contrast, may be more likely to have positive experiences prior to relapse.;,citation_author=Kimberly S. Walitzer;,citation_author=Ronda L.

This study describes the development and preliminary effectiveness of a smartphone-based, just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) to reduce alcohol use among adults experiencing homelessness. Methods We conducted a pilot trial (N = 41; mean age [SD] = 45.2 [11.5]; 19.5% women) of the Smart-T Alcohol JITAI where participants completed brief ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) each day, received personalized treatment messages following each EMA, and accessed on-demand intervention content for 4 weeks. The prediction algorithm and treatment messages were developed based on an independent but similar sample as part of the trial. We examined three drinking outcomes: daily drinking (yes/no), drinks per day, and heavy episodic drinking, controlling for scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) at baseline, age, and sex using quadratic growth curve models. Results Over the 4-week period, participants showed a decline in all alcohol use outcomes. Participants also reported high levels of satisfaction with the JITAI. Conclusions Use of the Smart-T Alcohol JITAI was well received and provided encouraging evidence that it may reduce any drinking, drinks per day, and heavy episodic drinking among adults experiencing homelessness.;,citation_author=Scott T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using machine learning to identify predictors of imminent drinking and create tailored messages for at-risk drinkers experiencing homelessness;,citation_abstract=Adults experiencing homelessness are more likely to have an alcohol use disorder compared to adults in the general population. Although shelter-based treatments are common, completion rates tend to be poor, suggesting a need for more effective approaches that are tailored to this understudied and underserved population. One barrier to developing more effective treatments is the limited knowledge of the triggers of alcohol use among homeless adults. This paper describes the use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to identify predictors of “imminent drinking” (i.e., drinking within the next 4&nbsp;h), among a sample of adults experiencing homelessness and receiving health services at a homeless shelter. A total of 78 mostly male (84.6%) adults experiencing homelessness (mean age&nbsp;=&nbsp;46.6) who reported hazardous drinking completed up to five EMAs per day over 4&nbsp;weeks (a total of 4557 completed EMAs). The study used machine learning techniques to create a drinking risk algorithm that predicted 82% of imminent drinking episodes within 4&nbsp;h of the first drink of the day, and correctly identified 76% of nondrinking episodes. The algorithm included the following 7 predictors of imminent drinking: urge to drink, having alcohol easily available, feeling confident that alcohol would improve mood, feeling depressed, lower commitment to being alcohol free, not interacting with someone drinking alcohol, and being indoors. The research team used the results to develop intervention content (e.g., brief tailored messages) that will be delivered when imminent drinking is detected in an upcoming intervention phase. Specifically, we created three theoretically grounded message tracks focused on urge/craving, social/availability, and negative affect/mood, which are further tailored to a participant’s current drinking goal (i.e., stay sober, drink less, no goal) to support positive change. To our knowledge, this is the first study to develop tailored intervention messages based on likelihood of imminent drinking, current drinking triggers, and drinking goals among adults experiencing homelessness.;,citation_author=Scott T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Just-in-the-Moment Adaptive Interventions (JITAI): A Meta-Analytical Review;,citation_abstract=A just-in-time, adaptive intervention (JITAI) is an emerging type of intervention that provides tailored support at the exact time of need. It does so using enabling new technologies (e.g., mobile phones, sensors) that capture the changing states of individuals. Extracting effect sizes of primary outcomes produced by 33 empirical studies that used JITAIs, we found moderate to large effect sizes of JITAI treatments compared to (1) waitlist-control conditions (k&nbsp;=&nbsp;9), Hedges’s g =&nbsp;1.65 and (2) non-JITAI treatments (k&nbsp;=&nbsp;21), g =&nbsp;0.89.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST): Development, reliability and feasibility;,citation_abstract=AIMS: The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) was developed for the World Health Organization (WHO) by an international group of substance abuse researchers to detect psychoactive substance use and related problems in primary care patients. This report describes the new instrument as well as a study of its reliability and feasibility. SETTING: The study was conducted at participating sites in Australia, Brazil, Ireland, India, Israel, the Palestinian Territories, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and Zimbabwe. Sixty per cent of the sample was recruited from alcohol and drug abuse treatment facilities; the remainder was drawn from general medical settings and psychiatric facilities. METHODS: The study was concerned primarily with test item reliability, using a simple test-retest procedure to determine whether subjects would respond consistently to the same items when presented in an interview format on two different occasions. Qualitative and quantitative data were also collected to evaluate the feasibility of the screening items and rating format. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 236 volunteer participants completed test and retest interviews at nine collaborating sites. Slightly over half of the sample (53.6%) was male. The mean age of the sample was 34 years and they had completed, on average, 10 years of education. RESULTS: The average test-retest reliability coefficients (kappas) ranged from a high of 0.90 (consistency of reporting ’ever’ use of substance) to a low of 0.58 (regretted what was done under influence of substance). The average kappas for substance classes ranged from 0.61 for sedatives to 0.78 for opioids. In general, the reliabilities were in the range of good to excellent, with the following items demonstrating the highest kappas across all drug classes: use in the last 3 months, preoccupied with drug use, concern expressed by others, troubled by problems related to drug use, intravenous drug use. Qualitative data collected at the end of the retest interview suggested that the questions were not difficult to answer and were consistent with patients’ expectations for a health interview. The data were used to guide the selection of a smaller set of items that can serve as the basis for more extensive validation research. CONCLUSION: The ASSIST items are reliable and feasible to use as part of an international screening test. Further evaluation of the screening test should be conducted.;,citation_author=WHO ASSIST Working Group;,citation_publication_date=2002-09;,citation_cover_date=2002-09;,citation_year=2002;,citation_issue=9;,citation_issn=0965-2140;,citation_pmid=12199834;,citation_volume=97;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Addiction (Abingdon, England);">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Modeling the complexity of post-treatment drinking: It’s a rocky road to relapse;,citation_abstract=The most widely cited road block to successful treatment outcomes for psychological and substance use disorders has been described as the return to the previous behavior, or “relapse.” The operational definition of “relapse” varies from study to study and between clinicians, but in general the term is used to indicate the return to previous levels of symptomatic behavior. One explanation for the variation in the operationalization of relapse is the wide variety of behaviors for which the term is applied, including (but not limited to): depression, substance abuse, schizophrenia, mania, sexual offending, risky sexual behavior, dieting, and the anxiety disorders. A second explanation for the multitude of definitions for relapse is the inherent complexity in the process of behavior change. In this paper we present the most recent treatment outcome research evaluating relapse rates, with a special focus on the substance use disorders. Following this review of the literature we present an argument for the operationalization of relapse as a dynamic process, which can be empirically characterized using dynamical systems theory. We support this argument by presenting results from the analysis of alcohol treatment outcomes using catastrophe modeling techniques. These results demonstrate the utility of catastrophe theory in modeling the alcohol relapse process. The implications of these analyses for the treatment of alcohol use disorders, as well as a discussion of future research incorporating nonlinear dynamical systems theory is provided.;,citation_author=Katie Witkiewitz;,citation_author=G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relapse prevention for alcohol and drug problems: That was zen, this is tao;,citation_abstract=Relapse prevention, based on the cognitive-behavioral model of relapse, has become an adjunct to the treatment of numerous psychological problems, including (but not limited to) substance abuse, depression, sexual offending, and schizophrenia. This article provides an overview of the efficacy and effectiveness of relapse prevention in the treatment of addictive disorders, an update on recent empirical support for the elements of the cognitive-behavioral model of relapse, and a review of the criticisms of relapse prevention. In response to the criticisms, a reconceptualized cognitive-behavioral model of relapse that focuses on the dynamic interactions between multiple risk factors and situational determinants is proposed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Applied Ambulatory Assessment: Integrating Idiographic and Nomothetic Principles of Measurement;,citation_abstract=Ambulatory assessment (also known as ecological momentary assessment) has enjoyed enthusiastic implementation in psychological research. The ability to assess thoughts, feelings, behavior, physiology, and context intensively and repeatedly in the moment in an individual’s natural ecology affords access to data that can answer exciting questions about sequences of events and dynamic processes in daily life. Ambulatory assessment also holds unique promise for developing personalized models of individuals (i.e., precision or person-specific assessment) that might be transformative for applied settings such as clinical practice. However, successfully translating ambulatory assessment from bench to bedside is challenging because of the inherent tension between idiographic and nomothetic principles of measurement. We argue that the value of applied ambulatory assessment will be most fully realized by balancing the ability to develop personalized models with ensuring comparability among individuals.;,citation_author=Aidan G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Modeling Heterogeneity in Momentary Interpersonal and Affective Dynamic Processes in Borderline Personality Disorder;,citation_abstract=Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a diagnosis defined by impairments in several dynamic processes (e.g., interpersonal relating, affect regulation, behavioral control). Theories of BPD emphasize that these impairments appear in specific contexts, and emerging results confirm this view. At the same time, BPD is a complex construct that encompasses individuals with heterogeneous pathology. These features—dynamic processes, situational specificity, and individual heterogeneity—pose significant assessment challenges. In the current study, we demonstrate assessment and analytic methods that capture both between-person differences and within-person changes over time. Twenty-five participants diagnosed with BPD completed event-contingent, ambulatory assessment protocols over 21 days. We used p-technique factor analyses to identify person-specific psychological structures consistent with clinical theories of personality. Five exemplar cases are selected and presented in detail to showcase the potential utility of these methods. The presented cases’ factor structures reflect not only heterogeneity but also suggest points of convergence.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Acceptability of Personal Sensing Among People With Alcohol Use Disorder: Observational Study;,citation_abstract=Background: Personal sensing may improve digital therapeutics for mental health care by facilitating early screening, symptom monitoring, risk prediction, and personalized adaptive interventions. However, further development and the use of personal sensing requires a better understanding of its acceptability to people targeted for these applications. Objective: We aimed to assess the acceptability of active and passive personal sensing methods in a sample of people with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder using both behavioral and self-report measures. This sample was recruited as part of a larger grant-funded project to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict lapses. Methods: Participants (N=154; n=77, 50% female; mean age 41, SD 11.9 years; n=134, 87% White and n=150, 97% non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1-8 weeks of abstinence) were recruited to participate in a 3-month longitudinal study. Participants were modestly compensated for engaging with active (eg, ecological momentary assessment [EMA], audio check-in, and sleep quality) and passive (eg, geolocation, cellular communication logs, and SMS text message content) sensing methods that were selected to tap into constructs from the Relapse Prevention model by Marlatt. We assessed 3 behavioral indicators of acceptability: participants’ choices about their participation in the study at various stages in the procedure, their choice to opt in to provide data for each sensing method, and their adherence to a subset of the active methods (EMA and audio check-in). We also assessed 3 self-report measures of acceptability (interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year) for each method. Results: Of the 192 eligible individuals screened, 191 consented to personal sensing. Most of these individuals (169/191, 88.5%) also returned 1 week later to formally enroll, and 154 participated through the first month follow-up visit. All participants in our analysis sample opted in to provide data for EMA, sleep quality, geolocation, and cellular communication logs. Out of 154 participants, 1 (0.6%) did not provide SMS text message content and 3 (1.9%) did not provide any audio check-ins. The average adherence rate for the 4 times daily EMA was .80. The adherence rate for the daily audio check-in was .54. Aggregate participant ratings indicated that all personal sensing methods were significantly more acceptable (all P&amp;amp;amp;lt;.001) compared with neutral across subjective measures of interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year. Participants did not significantly differ in their dislike of active methods compared with passive methods (P=.23). However, participants reported a higher willingness to use passive (vs active) methods for 1 year (P=.04). Conclusions: These results suggest that active and passive sensing methods are acceptable for people with alcohol use disorder over a longer period than has previously been assessed. Important individual differences were observed across people and methods, indicating opportunities for future improvement.;,citation_author=Kendra Wyant;,citation_author=Hannah Moshontz;,citation_author=Stephanie B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine learning models for temporally precise lapse prediction in alcohol use disorder;,citation_abstract=We developed three separate models that provide hour-by-hour probabilities of a future lapse back to alcohol use with increasing temporal precision (i.e., lapses in the next week, next day, and next hour). Model features were based on raw scores and longitudinal change in theoretically implicated risk factors collected through ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Participants (N=151; 51% male; mean age = 41; 87% White, 97% Non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1–8 weeks of abstinence) from alcohol use disorder provided 4x daily EMA for up to three months. We used grouped, nested cross-validation, with 1 repeat of 10-fold cross-validation for the inner loop and 3 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation for the outer loop to train models, select best models, and evaluate those best models on auROC. Models yielded median areas under the receiver operating curves (auROCs) of .90, .91, and .94 in the 30 held-out test sets for week, day, and hour level models, respectively. Some feature categories consistently emerged as being globally important to lapse prediction across our week, day, and hour level models (i.e., past use, future efficacy). However, most of the more punctuate, time varying constructs (e.g., craving, past stressful events, arousal) appear to have greater impact within the next hour prediction model. This research represents an important step toward the development of a smart (machine learning guided) sensing system that can both identify periods of peak lapse risk and recommend specific supports to address factors contributing to this risk. General scientific summary: This study suggests that densely sampled self-report data can be used to predict lapses back to alcohol use with varying degrees of temporal precision. Additionally, the contextual features contributing to risk of lapse may offer important insight for treatment matching through a digital therapeutic.;,citation_author=Kendra Wyant;,citation_author=Sarah June Kittleson Sant’Ana;,citation_author=Gaylen Fronk;,citation_author=John J.

This information can be explored for a broad range of applications and services. However, it is impractical to ask a large number of people to record their daily activities. As the increasing popularity of GPS-enabled mobile devices, a huge amount of trajectories which show people’s movement behaviors have been acquiring. The natural link between activities and traveling motivates us to investigate a novel approach to automatically extract sequences of activities from large set of trajectory data. Intuitively, activities can only happen when trajectory is geographically near for a proper period of time for these activities, such as 30 minutes for dining in a restaurant. In this work, the concepts influence and influence duration are proposed to capture the intuition. We also propose two algorithms to join large set of trajectories with activities with duplication reuse techniques. We conduct comprehensive empirical studies to evaluate the two algorithms with synthetic data set generated from real world POIs and road networks.;,citation_author=Kexin Xie;,citation_author=Ke Deng;,citation_author=Xiaofang Zhou;,citation_publication_date=2009-11;,citation_cover_date=2009-11;,citation_year=2009;,citation_doi=10.1145/1629890.1629897;,citation_isbn=978-1-60558-860-5;,citation_conference_title=Proceedings of the 2009 International Workshop on Location Based Social Networks;,citation_conference=Association for Computing Machinery;,citation_series_title=LBSN ’09;">

Patients have specific needs, such as avoiding being surprised by a possible outcome and making complex risk trade-off decisions. Yet all risk information is not equally informative for those needs. In this article, I present a taxonomy of seven risk concepts that vary in their inherent precision and evaluability. Congruent with the &quot;less is more&quot; concept, I argue that risk communications should use formats that are tailored to message recipients’ specific informational needs. Simpler formats can be used when patients only need to order risks, while more complex numerical probability statements will be necessary when patients need to assess differences in risk magnitude and put those differences into meaningful context. Selecting need-congruent formats when designing communications about risks to patients is a novel approach that may better support patients’ health care decision making.;,citation_author=Brian J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Evidence-based risk communication: A systematic review;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Effective communication of risks and benefits to patients is critical for shared decision making. PURPOSE: To review the comparative effectiveness of methods of communicating probabilistic information to patients that maximize their cognitive and behavioral outcomes. DATA SOURCES: PubMed (1966 to March 2014) and CINAHL, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1966 to December 2011) using several keywords and structured terms. STUDY SELECTION: Prospective or cross-sectional studies that recruited patients or healthy volunteers and compared any method of communicating probabilistic information with another method. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent reviewers extracted study characteristics and assessed risk of bias. DATA SYNTHESIS: Eighty-four articles, representing 91 unique studies, evaluated various methods of numerical and visual risk display across several risk scenarios and with diverse outcome measures. Studies showed that visual aids (icon arrays and bar graphs) improved patients’ understanding and satisfaction. Presentations including absolute risk reductions were better than those including relative risk reductions for maximizing accuracy and seemed less likely than presentations with relative risk reductions to influence decisions to accept therapy. The presentation of numbers needed to treat reduced understanding. Comparative effects of presentations of frequencies (such as 1 in 5) versus event rates (percentages, such as 20%) were inconclusive. LIMITATION: Most studies were small and highly variable in terms of setting, context, and methods of administering interventions. CONCLUSION: Visual aids and absolute risk formats can improve patients’ understanding of probabilistic information, whereas numbers needed to treat can lessen their understanding. Due to study heterogeneity, the superiority of any single method for conveying probabilistic information is not established, but there are several good options to help clinicians communicate with patients.

        <p>We developed machine learning models to predict future alcohol lapses within 24-hour windows lagged 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks. We engineered features from 4x daily ecological momentary assessment from individuals (N=151; 51% male; mean age=41; 87% non-Hispanic White) in early recovery over three months. We trained and evaluated models using nested cross-validation. Median posterior auROC was high (0.85–0.91) for all models but decreased modestly with increasing lag. Models performed worse for non-advantaged groups (non-White and/or Hispanic, below poverty, female). Past alcohol use, abstinence self-efficacy, and craving were the most important features, with the magnitude of importance varying meaningfully by lag. These findings demonstrate feasibility of predicting next-day lapses up to two weeks in advance. Embedding these models in a recovery monitoring support system could enable adaptive, personalized care. Improving model fairness and optimizing the delivery of model feedback to sustain engagement remain critical next steps.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Alcohol and other substance use disorders (SUDs) are serious chronic conditions, characterized by high relapse rates <span class="citation" data-cites="mclellanDrugDependenceChronic2000 dennisManagingAddictionChronic2007">[<a href="#ref-mclellanDrugDependenceChronic2000" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>,<a href="#ref-dennisManagingAddictionChronic2007" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span>, substantial co-morbidity with other physical and mental health problems <span class="citation" data-cites="substanceabuseandmentalhealthservicesadministration2023NSDUHDetailed dennisManagingAddictionChronic2007">[<a href="#ref-dennisManagingAddictionChronic2007" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>,<a href="#ref-substanceabuseandmentalhealthservicesadministration2023NSDUHDetailed" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>, and an increased risk of mortality <span class="citation" data-cites="hedegaardDrugOverdoseDeaths2021 centersfordiseasecontrolandpreventioncdcAnnualAverageUnited">[<a href="#ref-hedegaardDrugOverdoseDeaths2021" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>,<a href="#ref-centersfordiseasecontrolandpreventioncdcAnnualAverageUnited" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span>. Too few individuals receive medications or clinician-delivered interventions to help them initially achieve abstinence and/or reduce harms associated with their use <span class="citation" data-cites="substanceabuseandmentalhealthservicesadministration2023NSDUHDetailed">[<a href="#ref-substanceabuseandmentalhealthservicesadministration2023NSDUHDetailed" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>. Moreover, this problem is even worse for subsequent continuing care during SUD recovery. Continuing care, including both risk monitoring and ongoing support, is the gold standard for managing chronic health conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and HIV <span class="citation" data-cites="wagnerImprovingChronicIllness2001">[<a href="#ref-wagnerImprovingChronicIllness2001" role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span>. Yet, continuing care for SUDs is largely lacking despite ample evidence that SUDs are chronic, relapsing conditions <span class="citation" data-cites="substanceabuseandmentalhealthservicesadministration2023NSDUHDetailed stanojlovicTargetingBarriersSubstance2021 sociasAdoptingCascadeCare2016">[<a href="#ref-substanceabuseandmentalhealthservicesadministration2023NSDUHDetailed" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>,<a href="#ref-stanojlovicTargetingBarriersSubstance2021" role="doc-biblioref">7</a>,<a href="#ref-sociasAdoptingCascadeCare2016" role="doc-biblioref">8</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>An important focus of continuing care during SUD recovery is to prevent lapses (i.e., single instances of goal-inconsistent substance use) and full relapse back to harmful use <span class="citation" data-cites="marlattRelapsePreventionMaintenance1985 witkiewitzRelapsePreventionAlcohol2004">[<a href="#ref-marlattRelapsePreventionMaintenance1985" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>,<a href="#ref-witkiewitzRelapsePreventionAlcohol2004" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>]</span>. Critically, the risk factors that instigate lapses during recovery are individualized, numerous, dynamic, interactive, and non-linear <span class="citation" data-cites="witkiewitzModelingComplexityPosttreatment2007 brandonRelapseRelapsePrevention2007">[<a href="#ref-witkiewitzModelingComplexityPosttreatment2007" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>,<a href="#ref-brandonRelapseRelapsePrevention2007" role="doc-biblioref">12</a>]</span>. The optimal supports to address these risk factors and encourage continued, successful recovery vary both across individuals and within an individual over time. Given this, continuing care could benefit greatly from a precision mental health approach that seeks to provide the right support to the right individual at the right time, every time <span class="citation" data-cites="bickmanAchievingPrecisionMental2016 derubeisHistoryCurrentStatus2019 kranzlerPersonalizedTreatmentAlcohol2012">[<a href="#ref-bickmanAchievingPrecisionMental2016" role="doc-biblioref">13</a>–<a href="#ref-kranzlerPersonalizedTreatmentAlcohol2012" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span>. However, such monitoring and personalized support must also be highly scalable to address the substantial unmet need for SUD continuing care.</p>
<p>Recent advances in both smartphone sensing <span class="citation" data-cites="mohrPersonalSensingUnderstanding2017">[<a href="#ref-mohrPersonalSensingUnderstanding2017" role="doc-biblioref">16</a>]</span> and machine learning <span class="citation" data-cites="hastieElementsStatisticalLearning2009">[<a href="#ref-hastieElementsStatisticalLearning2009" role="doc-biblioref">17</a>]</span> hold promise as a scalable foundation for monitoring and personalized support during SUD recovery. Smartphone sensing approaches (e.g., ecological momentary assessment [EMA], geolocation sensing) can provide the frequent, longitudinal measurement of proximal risk factors that is necessary for prediction of future lapses with high temporal precision. EMA may be particularly well-suited for lapse prediction because it can provide privileged access to subjective experiences (e.g., craving, affect, stress, motivation, self-efficacy) that are targets for change in evidence-based approaches for relapse prevention <span class="citation" data-cites="marlattRelapsePreventionMaintenance1985 witkiewitzRelapsePreventionAlcohol2004 bowenMindfulnessBasedRelapsePrevention2021">[<a href="#ref-marlattRelapsePreventionMaintenance1985" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>,<a href="#ref-witkiewitzRelapsePreventionAlcohol2004" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>,<a href="#ref-bowenMindfulnessBasedRelapsePrevention2021" role="doc-biblioref">18</a>]</span>. Furthermore, individuals with SUDs have found EMA to be acceptable for sustained measurement for up to a year with relatively high compliance <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantAcceptabilityPersonalSensing2023 moshontzProspectivePredictionLapses2021">[<a href="#ref-wyantAcceptabilityPersonalSensing2023" role="doc-biblioref">19</a>,<a href="#ref-moshontzProspectivePredictionLapses2021" role="doc-biblioref">20</a>]</span>, suggesting that this method is feasible for long-term monitoring throughout SUD recovery.</p>
<p>Machine learning models are well-positioned to use EMAs as inputs to provide temporally precise prediction of the probability of future lapses with sufficiently high performance to support decisions about interventions and other supports for specific individuals. These models can handle the high dimensional feature sets that may result from feature engineering densely sampled raw EMA over time <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMachineLearningModels2023">[<a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2023" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>wyantMachineLearningModels2023?</strong></a>]</span>. They can also accommodate non-linear and interactive relationships between features and lapse probability that are likely necessary for accurate prediction of lapse probability. Moreover, rapid advances in the tools for interpretable machine learning (e.g., Shapley values <span class="citation" data-cites="lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017">[<a href="#ref-lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017" role="doc-biblioref">21</a>]</span>) now allow us to probe these models to understand which risk features contribute most strongly to a lapse prediction for a specific individual at a specific moment in time. Interventions, supports, and/or suggested lifestyle adjustments can then be personalized to address these risks following from our understanding about relapse prevention.</p>
<p>Preliminary research is now emerging that uses features derived from EMAs in machine learning models to predict the probability of future alcohol use <span class="citation" data-cites="soysterPooledPersonspecificMachine2022 waltersUsingMachineLearning2021 wyantMachineLearningModels2023">[<a href="#ref-soysterPooledPersonspecificMachine2022" role="doc-biblioref">22</a>,<a href="#ref-waltersUsingMachineLearning2021" role="doc-biblioref">23</a>,<a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2023" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>wyantMachineLearningModels2023?</strong></a>]</span>. This research is important because it rigorously required strict temporal ordering necessary for true prediction, with features measured before alcohol use outcomes. These studies also used resampling methods (e.g., cross-validation) that prioritize model generalizability to increase the likelihood these models will perform well with new people. Perhaps most importantly, <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMachineLearningModels2023">[<a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2023" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>wyantMachineLearningModels2023?</strong></a>]</span> demonstrated that machine learning models using EMA can provide predictions with very high temporal precision at clinically implementable levels of performance. Specifically, we developed models that predict lapses in the immediate future (i.e., the next day and even the next hour) with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROCs) of 0.91 and 0.93, respectively.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMachineLearningModels2023">[<a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2023" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>wyantMachineLearningModels2023?</strong></a>]</span>’s next day lapse prediction model can provide personalized support recommendations to address immediate risks for possible lapses. Features derived from past EMAs can be updated in the early morning to yield the predicted lapse probability for an individual that day. Personalized supports that target the top features contributing to that prediction can then be provided. For example, if predicted lapse probability is high due to frequent craving, the individual could be reminded about the benefits of urge surfing or distracting activities during brief periods when cravings arise. Conversely, guided relaxation techniques could be recommended if lapse probability is high due to recent past and anticipated stressors that day. Patients could also be assisted to implement any of these recommendations using videos or other tools within a digital therapeutic. Curtin and colleagues are currently evaluating outcomes associated with the use of this “smart” (machine learning guided) recovery monitoring and support system (RMSS) for patients with an alcohol use disorder (AUD) <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMaximizingEngagementTrustunderreview">[<a href="#ref-wyantMaximizingEngagementTrustunderreview" role="doc-biblioref">24</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Despite the promise offered by a smart RMSS based on immediate future risks (e.g., the next day), such a system has limitations. Most importantly, recommendations must be limited to previously learned skills and/or supports that are available to implement that day. However, many risks may require supports that are not available in the moment. For example, to address lifestyle imbalances, several future positive activities may need to be planned. Time with supportive friends or an AA sponsor may require time to schedule. Similarly, work or family schedules may need to be adjusted to return to attending self-help meetings. If new recovery skills or therapeutic activities are needed to address emerging risks, patients may need to book sessions with a therapist. In all these instances, patients would benefit from advanced warning about changes in their lapse probability and the associated risks that contribute to these changes. A smart RMSS could provide this advanced warning by lagging lapse probability predictions further into the future (e.g., predicting lapse probability in a 24-hour window that begins two weeks in the future). However, we do not know if such lagged models could maintain adequate performance for clinical implementation.</p>
<p>In this study, we evaluated the performance of machine learning models that predict the probability of future lapses within 24-hour prediction windows that were systematically lagged further into the future. We considered several meaningful lags for these prediction windows: 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks. We conducted pre-registered analyses of both the absolute performance of these lagged models and their relative performance compared to a baseline model that predicted lapse probability in the immediate next day (i.e., no lag). In addition to the aggregate performance of these models, we also evaluated algorithmic fairness by comparing model performance across important subgroups that have documented disparities in treatment access and/or outcomes. These include comparisons by race/ethnicity <span class="citation" data-cites="pinedoCurrentReexaminationRacial2019 kilaruIncidenceTreatmentOpioid2020">[<a href="#ref-pinedoCurrentReexaminationRacial2019" role="doc-biblioref">25</a>,<a href="#ref-kilaruIncidenceTreatmentOpioid2020" role="doc-biblioref">26</a>]</span>, income <span class="citation" data-cites="olfsonHealthcareCoverageService2022">[<a href="#ref-olfsonHealthcareCoverageService2022" role="doc-biblioref">27</a>]</span> and sex at birth <span class="citation" data-cites="greenfieldSubstanceAbuseTreatment2007 kilaruIncidenceTreatmentOpioid2020">[<a href="#ref-kilaruIncidenceTreatmentOpioid2020" role="doc-biblioref">26</a>,<a href="#ref-greenfieldSubstanceAbuseTreatment2007" role="doc-biblioref">28</a>]</span>. Finally, we calculated Shapley values for feature categories defined by EMA items to better understand how these models generate predictions and how these features can be used to tailor personalized supports.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="participants">Participants</h2>
<p>We recruited 192 participants in early recovery from AUD in Madison, Wisconsin, USA for a 3-month longitudinal study. This sample size was determined based on traditional power analysis methods for logistic regression <span class="citation" data-cites="hsiehSampleSizeTables1989">[<a href="#ref-hsiehSampleSizeTables1989" role="doc-biblioref">29</a>]</span> because comparable approaches for machine learning models have not yet been validated. Participants were recruited through print and targeted digital advertisements and partnerships with treatment centers. We required that participants:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>were age 18 or older,</li>
<li>could write and read in English,</li>
<li>had at least moderate AUD (&gt;= 4 self-reported DSM-5 symptoms),</li>
<li>were abstinent from alcohol for 1-8 weeks, and</li>
<li>were willing to use a single smartphone (personal or study provided) while on study.</li>
</ol>
<p>We also excluded participants exhibiting severe symptoms of psychosis or paranoia (Defined as scores &gt;2.2 or 2.8, respectively, on the psychosis or paranoia scales of the Symptom Checklist–90 <span class="citation" data-cites="derogatislBriefSymptomInventory">[<a href="#ref-derogatislBriefSymptomInventory" role="doc-biblioref">30</a>]</span>)</p>
<p>Of the 192 eligible participants, 191 consented to participate in the study at the screening visit, and 169 subsequently enrolled in the study at the enrollment visit, which occurred approximately one week later. Fifteen participants discontinued before the first monthly follow-up visit. We excluded data from one participant who did not maintain a goal of abstinence during their participation. We also excluded data from two participants due to evidence of careless responding and unusually low compliance. Our final sample consisted of 151 participants.</p>

<section id="procedure" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="procedure">Procedure</h2>
<p>Participants completed five study visits over approximately three months. After an initial phone screen, participants attended an in-person screening visit to determine eligibility, complete informed consent, and collect self-report measures. Eligible, consented participants returned approximately one week later for an intake visit. Three additional follow-up visits occurred about every 30 days that participants remained on study. Participants were expected to complete four daily EMAs. Other personal sensing data streams (geolocation, cellular communications, sleep quality, and audio check-ins) were collected as part of the parent grant’s aims (R01 AA024391). Participants could earn up to $150/month if they completed all study visits, had 10% or less missing EMA data, and opted in to provide data for other personal sensing data streams.</p>

<p>Participants completed four brief (7-10 questions) EMAs daily. The first and last EMAs of the day were scheduled within one hour of participants’ typical wake and sleep times. The other two EMAs were scheduled randomly within the first and second halves of their typical day, with at least one hour between EMAs. Participants learned how to complete the EMA and reviewed the meaning of each question with a member of the research team during their intake visit to ensure consistent question interpretation.</p>
<p>On all EMAs, participants reported dates and times of any previously unreported past alcohol use. Next, participants rated the maximum intensity of recent (i.e., since last EMA) experiences of craving, risky situations, stressful events, and pleasant events. Finally, participants rated their current affect on two bipolar scales: valence (Unpleasant/Unhappy to Pleasant/Happy) and arousal (Calm/Sleepy to Aroused/Alert). On the first EMA each day, participants also rated anticipated risky situations, stressful events, and the likelihood that they would drink alcohol in the next week (i.e., abstinence self-efficacy).</p>

<section id="predictions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="predictions">Predictions</h3>
<p>A <em>prediction timepoint</em> (<a href="#fig-method" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>, Panel A) is the hour at which our model calculates a predicted probability of a lapse within a future 24-hour prediction window for any specific individual. We calculated the features used to make predictions at each prediction timepoint within a feature scoring epoch that included all available EMAs up until, but not including, the prediction timepoint. The first prediction timepoint for each participant was 24 hours from midnight on their study start date. This ensured at least 24 hours of past EMAs were available in the feature scoring epoch. Subsequent prediction timepoints for each participant repeatedly rolled forward hour-by-hour until the end of their study participation.</p>
<p>The <em>prediction window</em> (<a href="#fig-method" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>, Panel B) spans a period of time in which a lapse might occur. The prediction window width for all models was 24 hours (i.e., models predicted the probability of a lapse occurring within a specific 24-hour period). Prediction windows rolled forward hour-by-hour with the prediction timepoint. However, there were five possible <em>lag times</em> between the prediction timepoint and start of the associated prediction window. A prediction window either started immediately after the prediction time point (no lag) or was lagged by 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, or 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Given this structure, our models provided hour-by-hour predicted probabilities of an alcohol lapse in a future 24-hour period. Depending on the model, that future period (the prediction window) might start immediately after the prediction timepoint or up to 2 weeks into the future. For example, at midnight on the 30th day of participation, the feature scoring epoch would include the past 30 days of EMAs. Separate models would predict the probability of lapse for 24-hour periods starting at midnight that day, or 24-hour periods starting 1 day, 3 days, 1 week or 2 weeks after midnight on day 30.</p>

<section id="labels" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="labels">Labels</h3>
<p>The start and end dates and times of past drinking episodes were reported on the first EMA item. A prediction window was labeled <em>lapse</em> if the start date/hour of any drinking episode fell within that window. A window was labeled <em>no lapse</em> if no alcohol use occurred within that window +/- 24 hours. If no alcohol use occurred within the window but did occur within 24 hours of the start or end of the window, the window was excluded. We used this conservative 24-hour fence for labeling windows as no lapse (vs.&nbsp;excluded) to increase the fidelity of these labels. Given that most windows were labeled no lapse, and the outcome was highly unbalanced, it was not problematic to exclude some no lapse events to further increase confidence in those labels.</p>
<p>This method produced totals of: 274,179 labels for the baseline (no lag) model; 270,911 labels for the 1-day lagged model; 264,362 labels for the 3-day lagged model; 251,458 labels for the 1-week lagged model; and 228,420 labels for the 2-week lagged model.</p>

<p>Features were calculated using only data collected in feature scoring epochs before each prediction timepoint to ensure our models were making true future predictions. For the no lag model, the prediction timepoint was at the start of prediction window, so all data prior to the start of the prediction window were included. For the lagged models, the prediction timepoint was 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, or 2 weeks prior to the start of the prediction window, so the last EMA data used for feature engineering were collected 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, or 2 weeks prior to the start of the prediction window.</p>
<p>A total of 285 features were derived from three data sources:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Prediction window</em>: We dummy-coded features for day of the week at the start of the prediction window.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Demographics</em>: We created quantitative features for age (in years) and personal income (in dollars), and dummy-coded features for sex at birth (male vs.&nbsp;female), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White vs.&nbsp;non-White and/or Hispanic), marital status (married vs.&nbsp;not married vs.&nbsp;other), education (high school or less vs.&nbsp;some college vs.&nbsp;college degree), and employment status (employed vs.&nbsp;unemployed).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Previous EMA responses</em>: We calculated raw and change features using EMAs in varying feature scoring epochs (i.e., 12, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours) before the prediction timepoint for all EMA items. Raw features included min, max, and median scores for each EMA item across all EMAs in each epoch for a given participant. We calculated change features by subtracting each participant’s baseline mean score for each EMA item from their raw feature. These baseline mean scores were calculated using all of a participant’s EMAs collected from the start of participation until the prediction timepoint. We also created raw and change features based on the most recent response for each EMA question and raw and change rate features from previously reported lapses and number of completed EMAs.</p></li>
</ol>
<!--JC to review paragraph below-->
<p>Features had missing values if the participant did not respond to the relevant EMA question during the associated scoring epoch. The proportion of missing values across features and models was low (median = .02, range = 0 - .13). We imputed missing data using median imputation for numeric features and mode imputation for nominal features. We selected coarse median/mode methods for handling missing data due to the computational costs associated with more advanced forms of imputation (e.g., KNN imputation, multiple imputation). Importantly, our imputation calculations are done using only held-in data and can be applied to any new observation.</p>
<p>Other generic feature engineering steps included removing zero and near-zero variance features as determined from held-in data. A sample feature engineering script (i.e., tidymodels recipe) containing all feature engineering steps is available on our OSF study page.</p>

<section id="model-configurations" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-configurations">Model Configurations</h4>
<p>We trained and evaluated five separate classification models: one baseline (no lag) model and one model for 1-day, 3-day, 1-week, and 2-week lagged predictions. We considered four well-established statistical algorithms (elastic net, XGBoost, regularized discriminant analysis, and single layer neural networks) that vary across characteristics expected to affect model performance (e.g., flexibility, complexity, handling higher-order interactions natively) <span class="citation" data-cites="kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018">[<a href="#ref-kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018" role="doc-biblioref">36</a>]</span>. Candidate model configurations differed across sensible values for key hyperparameters. Configurations also differed on outcome resampling method (i.e., no resampling and up-sampling and down-sampling of the outcome using majority/no lapse to minority/lapse ratios ranging from 5:1 to 1:1).</p>
</section>
<section id="cross-validation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cross-validation">Cross-validation</h4>
<p>We used participant-grouped, nested cross-validation for model training, selection, and evaluation with auROC. auROC indexes the probability that the model will predict a higher score for a randomly selected positive case (lapse) relative to a randomly selected negative case (no lapse). Grouped cross-validation assigns all data from a participant as either held-in or held-out to avoid bias introduced when predicting a participant’s data from their own data. Folds were stratified on a between-subject variable of low vs.&nbsp;high lapsers (low lapsers reported fewer than 10 lapses while on study, and high lapsers reported 10 or more lapses while on study). We used 2 repeats of 5-fold cross-validation for the inner loops (i.e., <em>validation</em> sets) and 6 repeats of 5-fold cross-validation for the outer loop (i.e., <em>test</em> sets). Best model configurations were selected using median auROC across the 10 validation sets. Final performance evaluation of those best model configurations used median auROC across the 30 test sets.</p>
</section>
<section id="bayesian-model" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bayesian-model">Bayesian Model</h4>
<p>We used a Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model to estimate the posterior probability distributions and 95% Bayesian credible intervals (CIs) from the 30 held-out test sets for our five best models. Following recommendations from the rstanarm team and others <span class="citation" data-cites="rstudioteamRStudioIntegratedDevelopment2020 gabryPriorDistributionsRstanarm2023">[<a href="#ref-rstudioteamRStudioIntegratedDevelopment2020" role="doc-biblioref">37</a>,<a href="#ref-gabryPriorDistributionsRstanarm2023" role="doc-biblioref">38</a>]</span>, we used the rstanarm default autoscaled, weakly informative, data-dependent priors that take into account the order of magnitude of the variables to provide some regularization to stabilize computation and avoid over-fitting. Priors were set as follows: residual standard deviation ~ normal(location=0, scale=exp(2)), intercept (after centering predictors) ~ normal(location=2.3, scale=1.3), the two coefficients for window width contrasts ~ normal (location=0, scale=2.69), and covariance ~ decov(regularization=1, concentration=1, shape=1, scale=1). We set two random intercepts to account for our resampling method: one for the repeat, and another for the fold nested within repeat. We specified two sets of pre-registered contrasts for model comparisons. The first set compared each lagged model to the baseline no lag model (1-day lag vs.&nbsp;no lag, 3-day lag vs.&nbsp;no lag, 1-week lag vs.&nbsp;no lag, 2-week lag vs.&nbsp;no lag). The second set compared adjacently lagged models (3-day lag vs.&nbsp;1-day lag, 1-week lag vs.&nbsp;3-day lag, 2-week lag vs.&nbsp;1-week lag). auROCs were transformed using the logit function and regressed as a function of model contrast.</p>
<p>From the Bayesian model we obtained the posterior distribution (transformed back from logit) and Bayesian CIs for auROCs for all five models. To evaluate our models’ overall performance, we report the median posterior probability for auROC and Bayesian CIs. This represents our best estimate for the magnitude of the auROC parameter for each model. If the CIs do not contain .5 (chance performance), this provides strong evidence (&gt; .95 probability) that our model is capturing signal in the data.</p>
<p>We then conducted Bayesian model comparisons using our two sets of contrasts - baseline and adjacent lags. For both model comparisons, we determined the probability that the models’ performances differed systematically from each other. We also report the precise posterior probability for the difference in auROCs and the 95% Bayesian CIs.</p>

<section id="fairness-analyses" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fairness-analyses">Fairness Analyses</h4>
<p>Using the same 30 held-out test sets, we calculated the median posterior probability and 95% Bayesian CI for auROC for each model separately by race/ethnicity (non-White and/or Hispanic vs.&nbsp;non-Hispanic White), income (below poverty line vs.&nbsp;above poverty line, and sex at birth (female vs.&nbsp;male). We used course race/ethnicity groupings due to the limited diversity of these demographics in our sample. The poverty cutoff was defined from the 2024 federal poverty line for the 48 contiguous United States. Participants at or below $15,060 annual income were categorized as below poverty. We conducted Bayesian group comparisons to assess the likelihood that each model performs differently by group. We summarize the differences in posterior probabilities for auROC across models. Individual Bayesian fairness contrasts for all five models are available in the supplement.</p>

<section id="model-characterization" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-characterization">Model Characterization</h3>
<p>To further characterize and understand our models, we used our inner resampling procedure (2 repeats of 5-fold cross validation grouped on participant and stratified by high/low lapsers) on the full data set to select a single best model configuration for each classification model (no lag, 1-day, 3-day, 1-week, and 2-week lag). The final configuration selected for each model represents the most reliable and robust configuration for deployment. We can better understand our final models by looking at the calibration of the predicted probabilities and the most important features contributing to those predictions.</p>
<section id="model-calibration" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-calibration">Model Calibration</h4>
<p>The best model configuration for each classification model was fit on the full data set. We fit this configuration using single 5-fold cross-validation. This method allowed us to obtain a single predicted probability for each observation, while still using separate data for model training and prediction. We calibrated our probabilities using Platt scaling <span class="citation" data-cites="plattProbabilisticOutputsSupport1999">[<a href="#ref-plattProbabilisticOutputsSupport1999" role="doc-biblioref">39</a>]</span>. We calculated Brier scores to assess the accuracy of our raw and calibrated probabilities for the no lag and 2-week lagged models. Brier scores range from 0 (perfect accuracy) to 1 (perfect inaccuracy). A table of Brier scores for all five models is available in the supplement. We provide calibration plots for the no lag and 2-week lagged models (calibration plots for all five models are available in the supplement).</p>

<section id="global-feature-importance" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="global-feature-importance">Global Feature Importance</h4>
<p>We used the same single 5-fold cross-validation procedure to calculate raw Shapley values for observations in our held-out folds. Raw Shapley values index the importance of any feature (or set/category of features as described below) to any single prediction for a specific observation (i.e., for a specific 24-hour window for a specific participant), which indicates the “local importance” of that feature <span class="citation" data-cites="lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017">[<a href="#ref-lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017" role="doc-biblioref">21</a>]</span>. More precisely, the magnitude of the raw Shapley value for any feature indicates how much the feature score for that observation adjusted the prediction (in log-odds units) for that observation relative to the mean prediction across all observations. Positive Shapley values indicate that the feature score increased the prediction for that observation and negative values indicate that the feature score decreased the prediction.</p>
<p>Raw Shapley values are additive across features for an observation, with their sum across features equal to the total adjustment of the predicted value for that observation vs.&nbsp;the mean predicted value across all observations. This property allows raw Shapley values to be added together across features within a category to index the importance of that feature category. We created feature categories by summing raw Shapley values for all features associated with specific EMA items. In three instances, we combined features across two similar EMA items (i.e., past and anticipated risky situations, past and anticipated stressful events, and affective valence and arousal) to yield seven feature categories for distinct constructs assessed by the original 10 EMA items. Specifically, we calculated Shapley values for past use, craving, affective state, past/anticipated risky situations, past/anticipated stressful events, past pleasant events, and abstinence self-efficacy.</p>
<p>Shapley values can be aggregated across observations to describe the global importance of any feature (or feature category) across all predictions (i.e., for all 24-hour windows for all participants) in the dataset. Global feature importance is calculated by averaging the absolute value of the Shapley values for a feature across all observations. A large mean absolute Shapley value indicates that the feature makes big contributions to the predictions across the dataset. Global feature importance is a descriptive statistic that indicates the importance of the feature for predictions in a specific dataset, rather than a hypothetical population of observations. We provide a descriptive plot of the relative ranking of feature categories by their global feature importance for the no lag and 2-week lagged models. Global feature importance plots for all five models are available in the supplement.</p>

<p><a href="#tbl-fairness" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;3</a> presents the median difference in auROC, 95% Bayesian CI, and posterior probability that the auROC difference was smaller than 0 for the three fairness contrasts: race/ethnicity (non-White and/or Hispanic; <em>N</em> = 20 vs.&nbsp;Non-Hispanic White; <em>N</em> = 131), sex at birth (female; <em>N</em> = 74 vs.&nbsp;male; <em>N</em> = 77), and income (below poverty line; <em>N</em> = 49 vs.&nbsp;above poverty line; <em>N</em> = 102). Median auROC differences less than 0 indicate the model, on average, performed worse for the non-advantaged group (female, non-White and/or Hispanic, below poverty line) compared to the advantaged group (male, non-Hispanic White, and above poverty line). In <a href="#tbl-fairness" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;3</a> we present fairness analyses for our baseline model (no lag) and for our longest lagged model (2-week lag), as this is likely the most clinically useful lagged model for providing advanced warning of lapse risk. Fairness analyses for all five models are available in the supplement.</p>
<p>There was strong evidence (probabilities &gt; .84) that our models performed worse for the non-advantaged groups compared to the advantaged groups. On average, across all five models, there was a median decrease in auROC of 0.13 (range 0.13-0.17) for participants who were non-White and/or Hispanic compared to participants who were non-Hispanic White. On average, across all five models, there was a median decrease in auROC of 0.05 (range 0.04-0.10) for female participants compared to male participants. On average, across all five models, there was a median decrease in auROC of 0.02 (range 0.01-0.04) for participants below the federal poverty line compared to participants above the federal poverty line.</p>
<p>The proportion of positive lapse labels over all labels (lapse and no lapse) for each demographic subgroup were relatively consistent across groups: race/ethnicity (6%, non-White and/or Hispanic vs.&nbsp;8%, non-Hispanic White), income (12%, below poverty line vs.&nbsp;7%, above poverty line), sex at birth (9%, female vs.&nbsp;7%, male).</p>

<p>The raw probabilities produced by our final models were not well calibrated. Consequently, we used Platt scaling to improve calibration.

<p>Global feature importance is an indicator of how important a feature category was to the model’s predictions, on average (i.e., across all participants and all observations). The top globally important feature category (i.e., highest mean |Shapley value|) for all models was past use. Future efficacy was a strong predictor for more immediate model predictions (i.e., no lag), but its importance diminished as lag time increased. On the other hand, as lag time increased, past/future risky situations increased in importance. Craving was consistently important in magnitude across all models. <a href="#fig-4" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a> shows the relative ranking of feature categories for the no lag and 2-week lagged models.

<section id="model-evaluation-and-comparisons" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-evaluation-and-comparisons">Model Evaluation and Comparisons</h2>
<p>All the models that we evaluated performed exceptionally well. The no lag model, which predicts the probability of an immediate (i.e., within 24 hours) lapse back to alcohol use, had a .91 median posterior probability for auROC. Our 2-week lagged model, which made the most distal predictions, had a .85 median posterior probability for auROC, suggesting lagged models can be used to shift a 24-hour prediction window meaningfully into the future.</p>
<p>Across models (no lag, 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks), model performance systematically decreased as models predicted further into the future. All lagged models had lower performance compared to the no lag baseline model and to the preceding adjacent lag model. This is unsurprising given what we know about prediction and substance use. Many important relapse risk factors are fluctuating processes that can first emerge and/or change day-by-day, if not more frequently. As lag time increases, features become less proximal to the start of the prediction window. Still, we wish to emphasize that our lowest auROC (.85) is still quite good, and the benefit of advanced notice (i.e., 2 weeks) likely outweighs the modest cost to model performance.</p>
<p>Collectively, these results suggest we can achieve clinically meaningful performance up to two weeks out. Our rigorous resampling methods (grouped, nested, k-fold cross-validation) make us confident that these are valid estimates of how our models would perform with new individuals. Furthermore, it should be noted that both the no lag and 2-week lagged models can be combined in a complementary fashion that allows both for highly accurate immediate lapse prediction and advanced warning about future lapse risk.</p>
</section>
<section id="model-fairness" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-fairness">Model Fairness</h2>
<p>In recent years, the machine learning field has begun to recognize the need to evaluate model fairness when algorithms are used to inform important decisions (e.g., healthcare services offered, eligibility for loans, early parole). Algorithms that perform favorably for only majority group members may exacerbate existing disparities in access to resources and important clinical outcomes <span class="citation" data-cites="veinotGoodIntentionsAre2018">[<a href="#ref-veinotGoodIntentionsAre2018" role="doc-biblioref">40</a>]</span>. In this study, we assessed model fairness by comparing model performance across important subgroups with known disparities in substance use treatment access and/or outcomes - race/ethnicity (non-White and/or Hispanic vs.&nbsp;non-Hispanic White), income (below poverty line vs.&nbsp;above poverty line), and sex at birth (female vs.&nbsp;male).</p>
<!-- JC review paragraph below-->
<p>All models performed worse for people who were non-White and/or Hispanic, and for people who had an income below the poverty line. These findings should be interpreted cautiously given the lack of diversity in our training data. Participants of color were severely underrepresented in our training data (<em>N</em> = 20, 13%). Individuals below the poverty line were also underrepresented, though to a lesser degree (<em>N</em> = 49, 32%). Nevertheless, these findings are concerning and the fact that we do not have adequate sample sizes for these comparisons highlight a large limitation of our study.</p>
<p>An obvious solution to this problem involves intentional recruitment for diversity in training data when developing prediction models. For example, we are now working to increase the racial, ethnic, and income diversity of our training data for alcohol lapse prediction while simultaneously optimizing feedback from these models for implementation purposes <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMaximizingEngagementTrustunderreview">[<a href="#ref-wyantMaximizingEngagementTrustunderreview" role="doc-biblioref">24</a>]</span>. In a separate project, we developed a national recruitment method that enabled us to recruit for racial, ethnic and income diversity while also focusing on much needed diversity across geographic location (e.g., rural vs.&nbsp;urban; <span class="citation" data-cites="moshontzProspectivePredictionLapses2021">[<a href="#ref-moshontzProspectivePredictionLapses2021" role="doc-biblioref">20</a>]</span>). We expect geographic diversity in the training data may also be crucial to develop fair models because the features that predict lapse in urban and suburban settings may differ from those that predict lapse in rural environments. If rural participants are not used to train models, the implementation of these models may compound existing disparities in SUD treatment in these communities <span class="citation" data-cites="leeUrbanRuralDisparities2023 listerSystematicReviewRuralspecific2020">[<a href="#ref-leeUrbanRuralDisparities2023" role="doc-biblioref">41</a>,<a href="#ref-listerSystematicReviewRuralspecific2020" role="doc-biblioref">42</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Future research can also explore potential computational solutions to mitigate performance disparities that emerge when subgroups are poorly represented in available training data. For example, training data from under-represented subgroups could be up-sampled (e.g., using the synthetic minority oversampling technique), or the cost functions used by the learning algorithms could be adjusted to differentially weigh prediction errors based on participant characteristics. In another vein, modeling approaches that yield idiographic, person-specific models <span class="citation" data-cites="fisherDynamicModelPsychological2015 davidIntraindividualDynamicNetwork2018 rocheEnrichingPsychologicalAssessment2014 wrightModelingHeterogeneityMomentary2016">[<a href="#ref-fisherDynamicModelPsychological2015" role="doc-biblioref">43</a>–<a href="#ref-wrightModelingHeterogeneityMomentary2016" role="doc-biblioref">46</a>]</span> may reduce performance disparities across subgroups. For example, we have begun to develop state space models whose parameters can be initialized with priors derived from existing training data but then adjusted over time to fit patterns present within a specific individual’s time-series <span class="citation" data-cites="pulickIdiographicLapsePrediction2025">[<a href="#ref-pulickIdiographicLapsePrediction2025" role="doc-biblioref">47</a>]</span>. Such models may mitigate issues of unfairness to a large degree because they will weigh the individual’s own data more heavily than group level estimates over time as more data accrue.</p>
<p>Of note, problems with model fairness can emerge even when subgroups are well-represented in the training data. Our models performed less well for women compared to men despite the fact that women were well-represented in the training data (<em>N</em> = 74, 49%). Instead, this differential performance may have resulted from more fundamental problems with the features available to the model. We chose our EMA items using domain expertise from decades of research on the factors that predict relapse. However, prior to the 1993 National Institute of Health Revitalization Act <span class="citation" data-cites="studiesNIHRevitalizationAct1994">[<a href="#ref-studiesNIHRevitalizationAct1994" role="doc-biblioref">48</a>]</span> that mandated the inclusion of minorities and women in research, women were mostly excluded from substance use treatment research due to their childbearing potential <span class="citation" data-cites="vannicelliEffectSexBias1984">[<a href="#ref-vannicelliEffectSexBias1984" role="doc-biblioref">49</a>]</span>. As a result, it is possible that our theories about the causes and contributors to relapse are biased toward constructs that are more relevant for men than women. If true, features derived from EMA items that tap these constructs would be expected to under-perform when predicting lapses for women. More research may be needed to identify relapse risk factors for women (e.g., interpersonal relationship problems <span class="citation" data-cites="walitzerGenderDifferencesAlcohol2006">[<a href="#ref-walitzerGenderDifferencesAlcohol2006" role="doc-biblioref">50</a>]</span>, hormonal changes <span class="citation" data-cites="mchughSexGenderDifferences2018">[<a href="#ref-mchughSexGenderDifferences2018" role="doc-biblioref">51</a>]</span>), and other groups under-represented in the literature before we can fully address these performance disparities.</p>
<p>In the meantime, data-driven (bottom-up) approaches can be used to engineer high-dimensional feature sets that are not explicitly grounded in existing, and potentially biased, theories. For example, we have begun to explore the application of natural language processing techniques (e.g., LIWC; topic modeling; BERT <span class="citation" data-cites="tausczikPsychologicalMeaningWords2010 bleiLatentDirichletAllocation2003 devlinBERTPretrainingDeep2019">[<a href="#ref-tausczikPsychologicalMeaningWords2010" role="doc-biblioref">52</a>–<a href="#ref-devlinBERTPretrainingDeep2019" role="doc-biblioref">54</a>]</span>) to text messages and other social media activity by our participants to engineer features that may predict future lapses. Such features may or may not align with existing theories about relapse, but because they are anchored to participants’ own words, they may serve as reliable indicators of lapse risk for certain individuals, particularly when used within learning algorithms that employ feature selection, regularization, or other techniques to address the bias-variance trade-off with high-dimensional feature sets. Furthermore, emerging techniques for interpreting machine learning models <span class="citation" data-cites="molnarInterpretableMachineLearning2022">[<a href="#ref-molnarInterpretableMachineLearning2022" role="doc-biblioref">55</a>]</span> can be applied to models that perform well to bootstrap the identification of new lapse risk constructs based on these novel features.</p>
<p>Beyond issues of training data representation and lacunae or outright biases in our theories, it is also true that historically marginalized groups that have experienced systemic racism, exclusion, or other stigma around substance use (e.g., societal expectations for women regarding attractiveness, cleanliness and motherhood <span class="citation" data-cites="meyersIntersectionGenderDrug2021">[<a href="#ref-meyersIntersectionGenderDrug2021" role="doc-biblioref">56</a>]</span>) may feel less trusting in disclosing substance use <span class="citation" data-cites="marwickPrivacyMarginsUnderstanding2018">[<a href="#ref-marwickPrivacyMarginsUnderstanding2018" role="doc-biblioref">57</a>]</span>. These experiences could prompt some individuals in these subgroups to under-report lapses and/or risk factors, which could also degrade performance and evaluation of our models for these subgroups. We observed relatively comparable percentages of lapses reported among disadvantaged compared to advantaged groups. However, comparable lapse rates do not necessarily confirm comparable reporting accuracy because it is possible that there were systematic differences in lapse rates across groups that were masked by issues of trust.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-characterization-1">Model Characterization</h2>
<section id="calibration" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="calibration">Calibration</h3>
<p>After applying Platt scaling to our predicted probabilities, our models were generally well calibrated with increasing monotonic relationships between calibrated model output and lapse event rates. Well-calibrated probabilities indicate that the predicted probability aligns closely with the true likelihood of an outcome (i.e., a lapse). Our no lag model had excellent calibration. However, the calibration plots suggest that with a longer lag time of 2 weeks, the model tends to over-predict the likelihood of lapses when predicted probabilities were higher.</p>
<p>This pattern may not necessarily be problematic. Research suggests that people often struggle to interpret probabilistic feedback, especially when it’s provided in raw numerical form <span class="citation" data-cites="zikmund-fisherRightToolWhat2013 fagerlinMakingNumbersMatter2007 zipkinEvidencebasedRiskCommunication2014">[<a href="#ref-zikmund-fisherRightToolWhat2013" role="doc-biblioref">58</a>–<a href="#ref-zipkinEvidencebasedRiskCommunication2014" role="doc-biblioref">60</a>]</span>. As a result, it may be more effective to communicate risk using coarser categories (e.g., low, medium, or high risk) or through relative changes in risk (e.g., “Your risk of lapse is higher this week compared to last week”). These forms of feedback may be less sensitive to small miscalibrations at the extremes as long as the relationship between predicted probabilities and the observed event rate is monotonic.</p>
</section>
<section id="feature-importance-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feature-importance-1">Feature importance</h3>
<p>The relative ordering of top global features remained somewhat consistent across the no lag and 2-week lagged models. Past use was the most important feature in both models in our dataset. This is not surprising given that our outcome was lapse, and past behavior is often the best predictor of future behavior. This finding also supports decades of clinical research on relapse prevention, where lapses (i.e., single instances of goal inconsistent alcohol use) are seen as powerful precursors to relapse (i.e., full return to harmful drinking; <span class="citation" data-cites="marlattRelapsePreventionMaintenance1985">[<a href="#ref-marlattRelapsePreventionMaintenance1985" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span>). Abstinence self-efficacy emerged as the second most important feature in both models in our dataset, indicating that participants had reasonably accurate insight into their near-term success with maintaining alcohol abstinence. Craving was also an important predictor in both models, suggesting that it may be an important target for intervention to support early recovery efforts.</p>
<p>Several feature categories displayed sizeable differences in global importance by lag time. The importance of abstinence self-efficacy dropped by more than 50% in the 2-week lagged model relative to the no lag model. This may indicate that self-efficacy during early recovery is unstable even across shorter periods of time such that their current self-efficacy does not strongly predict abstinence success even two weeks into the future. In fact, craving and risky situations become as important as self-efficacy when predicting two-week lagged lapses. It may be that these other experiences are shaping and changing the individual’s self-efficacy rapidly in early recovery. This also suggests that more frequent clinical assessments of self-efficacy as a target for intervention may be needed rather than assuming stability in this construct if initial assessment suggests it is high. Also, our study cannot determine if this differential importance of self-efficacy for immediate vs.&nbsp;lagged lapses persists beyond early recovery (where people may be encouraged to take a “one day at a time” mindset). Self-efficacy may become a more stable predictor of future abstinence success after longer periods of recovery, but our sample was limited to participants in early recovery (&lt;= 8 weeks of abstinence at intake).</p>
<p>Past use was less important for the 2-week lagged model compared to the no lag model. This indicates that the predictive strength of a lapse on the likelihood of subsequent lapses diminishes to some degree over a relatively short period of time. This is good news and reinforces that single lapses do not always mark a return to consistent patterns of frequent, and potentially harmful, alcohol use. Despite this reduction in importance of past use as a predictor of lagged alcohol use, past use did remain the most important category for two-week lagged lapses. Lapses may provide “teachable moments” that can be used to reinforce recovery motivation, better understand risks, and develop skills to address those risks <span class="citation" data-cites="witkiewitzModelingComplexityPosttreatment2007">[<a href="#ref-witkiewitzModelingComplexityPosttreatment2007" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span>. Conversely, lapses should not be ignored because they remain strong predictors of further use.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, past and anticipated risky situations were more important in the 2-week lagged vs.&nbsp;no lag model, suggesting that the impact of these situations on lapses back to use may be delayed. It may be that persistent exposure to risks is necessary to undermine an abstinence goal and lead to return to alcohol use. Alternatively or additionally, people may also be better able to anticipate future risky situations (e.g., vacations, anniversaries of significant dates) than future acute stressors or even future self-efficacy. Regardless, the increased importance of risky situations for predicting lagged lapses provides an opportunity to intervene prior to the lapse, particularly if the individual is encouraged to assess future risks and/or makes use of a recovery monitoring prediction model.</p>
<p>We were also surprised that stressful events, pleasant events, and affective state features did not make more important contributions to predictions across models. These constructs are highlighted in numerous theories about addiction and relapse <span class="citation" data-cites="marlattRelapsePreventionMaintenance1985 witkiewitzRelapsePreventionAlcohol2004 rawsonIntensiveOutpatientApproach1995">[<a href="#ref-marlattRelapsePreventionMaintenance1985" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>,<a href="#ref-witkiewitzRelapsePreventionAlcohol2004" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>,<a href="#ref-rawsonIntensiveOutpatientApproach1995" role="doc-biblioref">61</a>]</span> and represent targets for intervention in many existing treatments <span class="citation" data-cites="mchughCognitiveBehavioralTherapySubstance2010 lieseCognitiveBehavioralTherapyAddictive2022 bowenMindfulnessBasedRelapsePrevention2021 centerforsubstanceabusetreatmentCounselorsTreatmentManual2006">[<a href="#ref-bowenMindfulnessBasedRelapsePrevention2021" role="doc-biblioref">18</a>,<a href="#ref-mchughCognitiveBehavioralTherapySubstance2010" role="doc-biblioref">62</a>–<a href="#ref-centerforsubstanceabusetreatmentCounselorsTreatmentManual2006" role="doc-biblioref">64</a>]</span>. It may be that their impact is subsumed within other more powerful features (i.e., past use and self-efficacy). However, this seems unlikely given that the methodology underlying Shapley values allows for a fair distribution of importance among the relevant predictive features even when those features are correlated <span class="citation" data-cites="molnarInterpretableMachineLearning2022">[<a href="#ref-molnarInterpretableMachineLearning2022" role="doc-biblioref">55</a>]</span>. Alternatively, we may need to more carefully consider the nuanced roles that these constructs play (e.g., within the context of individual coping strategies, social support or environmental factors) in the return to alcohol use during recovery <span class="citation" data-cites="fronkStressAllostasisSubstance2020">[<a href="#ref-fronkStressAllostasisSubstance2020" role="doc-biblioref">65</a>]</span>.</p>

<section id="additional-limitations-and-future-directions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-limitations-and-future-directions">Additional Limitations and Future Directions</h2>
<p>We believe our lapse prediction models will be most effective when embedded in an RMSS designed to deliver adaptive and personalized continuing care. This system could send daily, weekly, or less frequent messages to users with personalized feedback about their risk of lapse and provide support recommendations tailored to their current recovery needs. This study provides initial support that immediate and lagged prediction models can be trained to high accuracy using EMA for recovery monitoring. Furthermore, locally important features from these models can be used to identify the specific factors that contribute to each lapse risk prediction.</p>
<p>The no lag model can be used to guide individuals to take immediate, actionable steps to maintain their recovery goals and support them to implement these steps within the RMSS. For example, the RMSS can recommend an embedded urge surfing activity when someone’s immediate risk is driven by strong craving whereas a guided relaxation video can be provided to the user when they report stressful events. Similarly, the RMSS can encourage (and explicitly support) the user to reflect on recent past successes and/or skills they have developed when their self-efficacy is low.</p>
<p>The 2-week lagged model provides individuals with advanced warning of their lapse risk. This model is well-suited to support recovery needs that cannot be addressed immediately within an RMSS app, such as scheduling positive or pleasant activities, increasing social engagement, or attending a peer-led recovery meeting. To be clear, we do not believe an RMSS app alone will be sufficient to deliver continuing care. We expect individuals will require additional support throughout their recovery from a mental health provider (e.g., motivational enhancement, crisis management, skill building), a peer (e.g., sponsor, support group), or family member. Importantly, these types of supports take time to set up, highlighting the value of this lagged 2-week model.</p>
<p>At this point, it is still unclear the best way to provide risk and support information from our models to people. For an RMSS to be successful, users must trust the system, consistently engage with the system over time, and find the system beneficial. We have recently launched an NIAAA funded project to optimize daily support messages by examining the impact of several key message components (e.g., lapse probability, locally important features, a risk-relevant recovery activity recommendation, the linguistic style and tone of the message) on engagement, trust, clinical outcomes <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMaximizingEngagementTrustunderreview">[<a href="#ref-wyantMaximizingEngagementTrustunderreview" role="doc-biblioref">24</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>For a system using lagged models, we can imagine that lags longer than two weeks (i.e., more advanced warning) would be better still. In the present study, we could not train models with lags longer than two weeks because participants only provided lapse reports for up to three months. With the 2-week lagged model, we had approximately 17% fewer labeled observations for training because the first two weeks (out of 12 weeks) of labels for each participant were discarded. This data loss may be one factor that contributed to the decreases in model performance with increases in lag time and we believed that greater data loss (e.g., 25% for a 3-week lag) would not be tenable. We have recently completed data collection on a NIDA funded project where participants provided EMA and other sensed data for up to 12 months <span class="citation" data-cites="moshontzProspectivePredictionLapses2021">[<a href="#ref-moshontzProspectivePredictionLapses2021" role="doc-biblioref">20</a>]</span>. These data will allow us to train models with longer lags and to better evaluate the impact of data loss on model performance because lag time can be increased substantially with proportionally less data loss given 52 weeks of labeled observations per participant.</p>
<!--JC to review paragraph below-->
<p>While the number of observations are large and support the complexity of a machine learning pipeline, we are limited by the number of participants. Successful machine learning models must generalize well to new data. Our analyses only speak to how well our models generalize to a mostly homogenous sample of 151 participants. We made the most efficient use of our sample (i.e., using nested cross-validation to maximize the amount of data used for both selection and evaluation); however, there is reason to worry about the generalizability to other populations, such as individuals living in rural locations and members of other diverse groups not adequately represented in our training data.</p>
<p>Additionally, our use of features from 4x daily EMA as model inputs may raise concerns about measurement burden. We confirmed that participants can comply with such EMA schedules over this time period and that they find it acceptable given its potential benefits to them <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantAcceptabilityPersonalSensing2023 jonesComplianceEcologicalMomentary2019">[<a href="#ref-wyantAcceptabilityPersonalSensing2023" role="doc-biblioref">19</a>,see also <a href="#ref-jonesComplianceEcologicalMomentary2019" role="doc-biblioref">66</a>]</span>. However, frequent daily surveys may become too burdensome within an RMSS intended for use over many, many months to years for long-term continuing care. We have begun to address this concern by training no lag models with fewer EMAs (1x daily) and have found comparable performance <span class="citation" data-cites="pulickIdiographicLapsePrediction2025">[<a href="#ref-pulickIdiographicLapsePrediction2025" role="doc-biblioref">47</a>]</span>. Additionally, reinforcement learning could potentially be used for adaptive EMA sampling. For example, each day the algorithm could make a decision to send out an EMA or not based on inferred latent states of the individual based on previous EMA responses and predicted probability of lapse.</p>
<p>We have also begun to explore how we can supplement our models with data from lower burden sensing methods. Geolocation, which can be passively sensed, could compliment EMA well <span class="citation" data-cites="baeLeveragingMobilePhone2023">[<a href="#ref-baeLeveragingMobilePhone2023" role="doc-biblioref">67</a>]</span>. First, it could provide insight into information not easily captured by self-report without lengthy surveys. For example, the amount of time spent in risky locations, or changes in routine (e.g., loss of job; move to new city) that could indicate life stressors can be detected in movement patterns. Second, the near-continuous sampling of geolocation could offer risk-relevant information that would otherwise be missed in between the discrete sampling periods of EMA. Furthermore, potentially powerful features can be engineered by combining geolocation data with contextual information available in public sources (e.g., census data, alcohol outlet density) <span class="citation" data-cites="huangActivityIdentificationGPS2010 xieTrajectoriesActivitiesSpatiotemporal2009">[<a href="#ref-huangActivityIdentificationGPS2010" role="doc-biblioref">68</a>,<a href="#ref-xieTrajectoriesActivitiesSpatiotemporal2009" role="doc-biblioref">69</a>]</span> or collected from the user directly (e.g., self-evaluated riskiness of a given location) <span class="citation" data-cites="moshontzProspectivePredictionLapses2021">[<a href="#ref-moshontzProspectivePredictionLapses2021" role="doc-biblioref">20</a>]</span>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>This study suggests it is possible to accurately predict alcohol lapses both immediately and up to two weeks into the future using lagged machine learning prediction models. The no lag model could guide users to engage with a smart RMSS that provides daily recovery activities that are personalized to their lapse risk and the factors contributing to that risk. The 2-week lagged model could enable patients to seek out and implement recovery support that is not immediately available to them within the RMSS. Several important steps remain prior to implementing the no lag and 2-week lagged models within a smart RMSS. Feedback and support messages from these models should be optimized to sustain system engagement, trust, and clinical outcomes. Passive sensing of model inputs may allow assessment of a broader range of risk factors with less burden for system users. Perhaps most important, model fairness must be improved by decreasing disparities in performance for less privileged groups. We remain optimistic about the potential to implement these models within a smart RMSS because these barriers, while challenging, are surmountable.</p>
