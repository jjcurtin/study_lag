<meta name="citation_abstract" content="We evaluated machine learning models predicting future alcohol lapses within 24-hour prediction windows that were systematically lagged further into the future (1 day, 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks). We engineered features from 4x daily ecological momentary assessment. Participants (N=151; 51% male; mean age=41; 87% White, 97% Non-Hispanic) in early recovery from alcohol use disorder provided data for up to three months. We used nested cross-validation to select and evaluate models. Median posterior probabilities for auROCs were high (0.84–0.90). Still, performance declined with increasing lags (probabilities &amp;amp;gt; .98). Models also performed worse for disadvantaged groups (not White vs. non-Hispanic White, below poverty vs. above poverty, female vs. male; probabilities > .96). This study demonstrates the feasibility of predicting next-day alcohol lapses up to two weeks into the future. This advanced notice offers time to implement support options not immediately available. However, fairness concerns remain and are discussed further in the paper.

The sample was composed of adults receiving publicly funded outpatient treatment in Washington State. Treatment data were linked to data from the US census. The outcome studied was “Initiation and Engagement” in treatment (IET), a measure noting timely receipt of services at the beginning of treatment.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mobile phone sensors and supervised machine learning to identify alcohol use events in young adults: Implications for just-in-time adaptive interventions;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Real-time detection of drinking could improve timely delivery of interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related injury, but existing detection methods are burdensome or impractical. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether phone sensor data and machine learning models are useful to detect alcohol use events, and to discuss implications of these results for just-in-time mobile interventions. METHODS: 38 non-treatment seeking young adult heavy drinkers downloaded AWARE app (which continuously collected mobile phone sensor data), and reported alcohol consumption (number of drinks, start/end time of prior day’s drinking) for 28days. We tested various machine learning models using the 20 most informative sensor features to classify time periods as non-drinking, low-risk (1 to 3/4 drinks per occasion for women/men), and high-risk drinking ($&amp;amp;amp;gt;$4/5 drinks per occasion for women/men). RESULTS: Among 30 participants in the analyses, 207 non-drinking, 41 low-risk, and 45 high-risk drinking episodes were reported. A Random Forest model using 30-min windows with 1day of historical data performed best for detecting high-risk drinking, correctly classifying high-risk drinking windows 90.9% of the time. The most informative sensor features were related to time (i.e., day of week, time of day), movement (e.g., change in activities), device usage (e.g., screen duration), and communication (e.g., call duration, typing speed). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence suggests that sensor data captured from mobile phones of young adults is useful in building accurate models to detect periods of high-risk drinking. Interventions using mobile phone sensor features could trigger delivery of a range of interventions to potentially improve effectiveness.;,citation_author=Sangwon Bae;,citation_author=Tammy Chung;,citation_author=Denzil Ferreira;,citation_author=Anind K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Adaptation, personalization and capacity in mental health treatments: A balancing act?;,citation_abstract=Purpose of review&nbsp; There are increasing calls for mental health treatments to be adapted for different groups to maximize their acceptability and benefit to patients. However, adaptations can be costly to develop and evaluate, difficult to implement in routine clinical practice and may reduce service capacity at a time when there is unprecedented unmet need. An alternative method is personalization on an individual level. This review provides an overview of the issues related to personalization and adaptation of mental health interventions. Recent findings&nbsp; Several terms have been used to describe changes to existing therapies, these reflect different extents to which existing treatments have been changed. Evidence-based practice and modular therapies allow a level of flexibility within intervention delivery without formal changes and not all changes to therapy should be considered as a new/adapted treatment but instead regarded as “metacompetence”. Implementing existing interventions in new contexts is preferable to developing new interventions in many instances. New guidance outlines how researchers can adapt and transfer interventions to varied contexts. Summary&nbsp; The review provides proposed definitions of different changes to therapy. Modified and personalized treatments may improve acceptability to patients whilst maximizing implementation of evidence-based practice within clinical services.;,citation_author=Sophie D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Designing m-Health interventions for precision mental health support;,citation_abstract=Mobile health (m-Health) resources are emerging as a significant tool to overcome mental health support access barriers due to their ability to rapidly reach and provide support to individuals in need of mental health support. m-Health provides an approach to adapt and initiate mental health support at precise moments, when they are most likely to be effective for the individual. However, poor adoption of mental health apps in the real world suggests that new approaches to optimising the quality of m-Health interventions are critically needed in order to realise the potential translational benefits for mental health support. The micro-randomised trial is an experimental approach for optimising and adapting m-Health resources. This trial design provides data to construct and optimise m-Health interventions. The data can be used to inform when and what type of m-Health interventions should be initiated, and thus serve to integrate interventions into daily routines with precision. Here, we illustrate this approach in a case study, review implementation issues that need to be considered while conducting an MRT, and provide a checklist for mental health m-Health intervention developers.;,citation_author=N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relapse and relapse prevention;,citation_abstract=Abstract Most psychological disorders and problem behaviors are characterized by very high rates of postremittance relapse. Thus, advances in the long-term efficacy of psychological interventions require understanding the causes and processes of relapse, with the ultimate goal of developing strategies that reduce the probability of relapse. Existing psychological theory and interventions relevant to relapse and relapse prevention (RP) are reviewed, with a focus on addictive behaviors. The past two decades have produced increased attention toward the relapse problem and important advances in the conceptualization of relapse (i.e., as a process rather than a discrete event). Further progress will require the translation of basic theory into applied theory, the development of integrative theories of relapse, and the design and testing of theory-based, multimodal RP interventions.;,citation_author=Thomas H.

Addiction-comprehensive health enhancement support system (A-CHESS) is a smartphone application that aims to reduce relapse. To offer targeted support to patients who are at risk of lapses within the coming week, a Bayesian network model to predict such events was constructed using responses on 2,934 weekly surveys (called the Weekly Check-in) from 152 alcohol-dependent individuals who recently completed residential treatment. The Weekly Check-in is a self-monitoring service, provided in A-CHESS, to track patients’ recovery progress. The model showed good predictability, with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.829 in the 10-fold cross-validation and 0.912 in the external validation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Treatment use, perceived need, and barriers to seeking treatment for substance abuse and mental health problems among older adults compared to younger adults;,citation_abstract=Background This study examined age group differences in and correlates of treatment use and perceived treatment need for substance use disorders (SUD) and mental health (MH) problems as well as self-reported barriers to treatment among people 65+ years old vs. 26–34, 35–49, and 50–64 years old. Methods Data are from the 2008 to 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) (N=96,966). Age group differences were examined using descriptive bivariate analyses and binary logistic regression analyses. Results The 65+ age group was least likely to use treatment and perceive treatment need, but the 50–64 age group was more similar to the younger age groups than the 65+ age group. Controlling for age, other predisposing, and enabling factors, alcohol and illicit drug dependence and comorbid SUD and MH problems increased the odds of SUD treatment use. Of MH problems, anxiety disorder had the largest odds for MH treatment use. Bivariate analyses showed that lack of readiness to stop using and cost/limited insurance were the most frequent barriers to SUD and MH treatment, respectively, among older adults, and they were less likely than younger age groups to report stigma/confidentiality concerns for MH treatment. Conclusions Older adults will become a larger portion of the total U.S. population with SUD and/or MH problems. Healthcare providers should be alert to the need to help older adults with SUD and/or MH problems obtain treatment.;,citation_author=Namkee G. Choi;,citation_author=Diana M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Depression From a Precision Mental Health Perspective: Utilizing Personalized Conceptualizations to Guide Personalized Treatments;,citation_abstract=$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$p$&amp;gt;$Modern research has proven that the “typical patient” requiring standardized treatments does not exist, reflecting the need for more personalized approaches for managing individual clinical profiles rather than broad diagnoses. In this regard, precision psychiatry has emerged focusing on enhancing prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric disorders through identifying clinical subgroups, suggesting personalized evidence-based interventions, assessing the effectiveness of different interventions, and identifying risk and protective factors for remission, relapse, and vulnerability. Literature shows that recent advances in the field of precision psychiatry are rapidly becoming more data-driven reflecting both the significance and the continuous need for translational research in mental health. Different etiologies underlying depression have been theorized and some factors have been identified including neural circuitry, biotypes, biopsychosocial markers, genetics, and metabolomics which have shown to explain individual differences in pathology and response to treatment. Although the precision approach may prove to enhance diagnosis and treatment decisions, major challenges are hindering its clinical translation. These include the clinical diversity of psychiatric disorders, the technical complexity and costs of multiomics data, and the need for specialized training in precision health for healthcare staff, besides ethical concerns such as protecting the privacy and security of patients’ data and maintaining health equity. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of recent findings in the conceptualization and treatment of depression from a precision mental health perspective and to discuss potential challenges and future directions in the application of precision psychiatry for the treatment of depression.$&amp;lt;$/p$&amp;gt;$;,citation_author=Reem Deif;,citation_author=Mohamed Salama;,citation_publication_date=2021-05;,citation_cover_date=2021-05;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2021.650318;,citation_issn=1664-0640;,citation_volume=12;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychiatry;,citation_publisher=Frontiers;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The history, current status, and possible future of precision mental health;,citation_abstract=In evidence-based mental health practice, decisions must often be made for which there is little or no empirical basis. A common example of this is when there are multiple empirically supported interventions for a person with a given diagnosis, where the aim is to recommend the treatment most likely to be effective for that person. Data obtained from randomized clinical trials allow for the identification of patient characteristics that could be used to match patients to treatments. Historically, researchers have focused on individual moderators, single variables that interact statistically with treatment type, but these have rarely proved powerful enough to inform treatment decisions. Recently, researchers have begun to explore ways in which the use of multivariable algorithms might improve clinical decision-making. Common pitfalls have been identified, including the use of methods that provide overoptimistic estimates of the gains that can be expected from the applications of an algorithm in a clinical setting. It is too early to tell if these efforts will pay off and, if so, how much their use can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of mental health systems. It behooves the field to continue to learn and develop the most powerful methods that can produce generalizable knowledge that will advance the aims of precision mental health.;,citation_author=Robert J.

Employing the algorithms provided by Fernandez, Fisher, and Chi (2017), the present study collected intensive repeated measures data prior to therapy in order to perform person-specific factor analysis and dynamic factor modeling. The results of these analyses were then used to generated personalized modular treatment plans on a person-by-person basis. Thirty-two participants completed therapy.

Results:&nbsp; The number of providers listed in each county ranged from 1 to 166, with 5 counties having $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$10 providers. In 3 counties no appointments were obtained, and another 3 counties had $\leq$3 providers with availability. Of the 505 providers listed, 355 providers (70.3%) were reached, 310 (61.4%) of the 505 listings were correct numbers, and 195 (38.6%) of the 505 providers in the listings provided buprenorphine. Of the 173 clinics that provided buprenorphine and were asked about insurance, 131 (75.7%) accepted insurance. Of the 167 clinics that provided buprenorphine and were asked about Medicaid, 105 (62.9%) accepted it. Wait times for appointments ranged from 1 to 120 days, with an average of 16.8 days for those that had a waitlist. Among the 39 providers who reported out-of-pocket costs, the average cost was $231 (range: $90 to $600). One hundred forty of the 505 providers listed in the database had appointments available (27.7%). Three hundred sixty-five of the 505 providers did not have appointments available (72.3%) for various reasons, including the fact that 120 providers (32.9% of the 365 providers) could not be reached, and 137 of the numbers (37.5% of the 365 listed numbers) were wrong. Other reasons appointments could not be obtained included the fact that providers did not treat outpatients, were not accepting new patients, were out of office, or required a referral. Conclusion:&nbsp; Although the SAMHSA buprenorphine practitioner locator is used by patients and providers to locate treatment options, only a small portion of clinicians in the database ultimately offered initial appointments, implying that the database is only marginally useful for patients.;,citation_author=Lila Flavin;,citation_author=Monica Malowney;,citation_author=Nikhil A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The economic burden of opioid use disorder and fatal opioid overdose in the United States, 2017;,citation_abstract=Background The United States (U.S.) is experiencing an ongoing opioid crisis. Economic burden estimates that describe the impact of the crisis are needed when considering federal and state resources devoted to addressing overdoses. In this study, we estimate the societal costs for opioid use disorder and fatal overdose from all opioids in 2017. Methods We estimated costs of fatal overdose from all opioids and opioid use disorder based on the incidence of overdose deaths and the prevalence of past-year opioid use disorder for 2017. Incidence of fatal opioid overdose was obtained from the National Vital Statistics System; prevalence of past-year opioid use disorder was estimated from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health. Costs were estimated for health care, criminal justice and lost productivity. Costs for the reduced quality of life for opioid use disorder and life lost due to fatal opioid overdose were valued using U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for valuing reductions in morbidity and mortality. Results Costs for opioid use disorder and fatal opioid overdose in 2017 were estimated to be $1.02 trillion. The majority of the economic burden is due to reduced quality of life from opioid use disorder and the value of life lost due to fatal opioid overdose. Conclusions These estimates can assist decision makers in understanding the magnitude of opioid use disorder and fatal overdose. Knowing the magnitude and distribution of the economic burden can inform public policy, clinical practice, research, and prevention and response activities.;,citation_author=Curtis Florence;,citation_author=Feijun Luo;,citation_author=Ketra Rice;,citation_publication_date=2021-01;,citation_cover_date=2021-01;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108350;,citation_issn=0376-8716;,citation_volume=218;,citation_journal_title=Drug and Alcohol Dependence;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The effect of matching comprehensive services to patients’ needs on drug use improvement in addiction treatment;,citation_abstract=Aims To examine whether need–service matching in addiction treatment leads to improvements in drug use, and whether treatment duration mediates those improvements. Design, participants, measurements This analysis utilizes prospective data from a US cohort of addiction treatment patients who reported service needs beyond core rehabilitative services (n = 3103). “Drug use improvement” is the difference between the patient’s peak drug use frequency (in days per month) in the year before intake and in the year after treatment. Overall and primary use of the major illicit drugs (heroin, powder or crack cocaine and marijuana) are considered separately. “Need–service match” means that a patient rated a service as important at intake and reported its receipt during treatment. “Percentage of needs matched” indicates the proportion of five service domains (medical, mental health, family, vocational and housing) so matched. Findings In mixed regression models controlling for multiple factors, a greater percentage of needs matched tended to improve primary ($\beta$ = 0.028, P = 0.09) and overall ($\beta$ = 0.049, P = 0.05) drug use in the follow-up year. Exclusion of treatment duration as a covariate doubled the magnitude of these coefficients. The benefits of matching were concentrated among the half of patients reporting needs in four to five rather than one to three domains, and were strongest among patients in long-term residential facilities. Addressing vocational and housing needs exerted the greatest effects. Conclusions Matching comprehensive services to needs is a useful addiction treatment practice, especially for high-need patients. Treatment duration might partially mediate its effect.;,citation_author=Peter D. Friedmann;,citation_author=James C. Hendrickson;,citation_author=Dean R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Stress Allostasis in Substance Use Disorders: Promise, Progress, and Emerging Priorities in Clinical Research;,citation_abstract=Clinicians and researchers alike have long believed that stressors play a pivotal etiologic role in risk, maintenance, and/or relapse of alcohol and other substance use disorders (SUDs). Numerous seminal and contemporary theories on SUD etiology posit that stressors may motivate drug use and that individuals who use drugs chronically may display altered responses to stressors. We use foundational basic stress biology research as a lens through which to evaluate critically the available evidence to support these key stress–SUD theses in humans. Additionally, we examine the field’s success to date in targeting stressors and stressor reactivity in treatments for SUDs. We conclude with our recommendations for how best to advance our understanding of the relationship between stressors and drug use, and we discuss clinical implications for treatment development.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Substance abuse treatment entry, retention, and outcome in women: A review of the literature;,citation_abstract=This paper reviews the literature examining characteristics associated with treatment outcome in women with substance use disorders. A search of the English language literature from 1975 to 2005 using Medline and PsycInfo databases found 280 relevant articles. Ninety percent of the studies investigating gender differences in substance abuse treatment outcomes were published since 1990, and of those, over 40% were published since the year 2000. Only 11.8% of these studies were randomized clinical trials. A convergence of evidence suggests that women with substance use disorders are less likely, over the lifetime, to enter treatment compared to their male counterparts. Once in treatment, however, gender is not a significant predictor of treatment retention, completion, or outcome. Gender-specific predictors of outcome do exist, however, and individual characteristics and treatment approaches can differentially affect outcomes by gender. While women-only treatment is not necessarily more effective than mixed-gender treatment, some greater effectiveness has been demonstrated by treatments that address problems more common to substance-abusing women or that are designed for specific subgroups of this population. There is a need to develop and test effective treatments for specific subgroups such as older women with substance use disorders, as well as those with co-occurring substance use and psychiatric disorders such as eating disorders. Future research on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of gender-specific versus standard treatments, as well as identification of the characteristics of women and men who can benefit from mixed-gender versus single-gender treatments, would advance the field.;,citation_author=Shelly F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Disparities in Latino substance use, service use, and treatment: Implications for culturally and evidence-based interventions under health care reform;,citation_abstract=Background The goal of this systematic literature review was to enhance understanding of substance use, service use, and treatment among Latino subgroups to improve access to care and treatment outcomes in an era of health care reform. Methods The authors used 13 electronic databases and manually searched the literature from January 1, 1978, to May 30, 2013. One hundred (69%) of 145 primary research articles met the inclusion criteria. Two blinded, independent reviewers scored each article. Consensus discussions and a content expert reconciled discrepancies. Results Current rates of alcohol and substance abuse among Latinos are comparable to or surpass other U.S. ethnic groups. Disparities in access and quality of care are evident between Latinos and other ethnic groups. As a heterogeneous group, Latinos vary by geographic region in terms of substance of choice and their cultural identity takes precedence over general ethnic identity as a likely determinant of substance abuse behaviors. There is growing research interest in systems influencing treatment access and adherence among racial/ethnic and gender minority groups. However, studies on Latinos’ service use and immediate treatment outcomes have been both limited in number and inconsistent in findings. Conclusions This review identified human capital, quality of care, and access to culturally responsive care as key strategies to eliminate disparities in health and treatment quality. Implications are discussed, including the need for effectiveness studies on Latinos served by systems of care that, under health care reform, are seeking to maximize resources, improve outcomes, and reduce variation in quality of care.;,citation_author=Erick G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A smartphone application to support recovery from alcoholism: A randomized clinical trial;,citation_abstract=IMPORTANCE: Patients leaving residential treatment for alcohol use disorders are not typically offered evidence-based continuing care, although research suggests that continuing care is associated with better outcomes. A smartphone-based application could provide effective continuing care. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients leaving residential treatment for alcohol use disorders with a smartphone application to support recovery have fewer risky drinking days than control patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An unmasked randomized clinical trial involving 3 residential programs operated by 1 nonprofit treatment organization in the Midwestern United States and 2 residential programs operated by 1 nonprofit organization in the Northeastern United States. In total, 349 patients who met the criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence when they entered residential treatment were randomized to treatment as usual (n = 179) or treatment as usual plus a smartphone (n = 170) with the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS), an application designed to improve continuing care for alcohol use disorders. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment as usual varied across programs; none offered patients coordinated continuing care after discharge. A-CHESS provides monitoring, information, communication, and support services to patients, including ways for patients and counselors to stay in contact. The intervention and follow-up period lasted 8 and 4 months, respectively. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risky drinking days–the number of days during which a patient’s drinking in a 2-hour period exceeded 4 standard drinks for men and 3 standard drinks for women, with standard drink defined as one that contains roughly 14 g of pure alcohol (12 oz of regular beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz of distilled spirits). Patients were asked to report their risky drinking days in the previous 30 days on surveys taken 4, 8, and 12 months after discharge from residential treatment. RESULTS: For the 8 months of the intervention and 4 months of follow-up, patients in the A-CHESS group reported significantly fewer risky drinking days than did patients in the control group, with a mean of 1.39 vs 2.75 days (mean difference, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.46-2.27; P = .003). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that a multifeatured smartphone application may have significant benefit to patients in continuing care for alcohol use disorders.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Receiving addiction treatment in the US: Do patient demographics, drug of choice, or substance use disorder severity matter?;,citation_abstract=Background Understanding addiction treatment needs and utilization is important to health systems and government to develop policies that effectively address substance use disorders (SUDs) at a population level. This study aims to describe differences in treatment receipt by diagnostic category, drug of choice, and demographic characteristics in an effort to identify potential disparities in receipt of care. Methods Using data from the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, we calculated the proportion of various groups that received treatment and conducted binary logistic regression to determine the association between addiction treatment receipt and SUD severity, drug of choice, and patient demographics. Results Using DSM-5, 16.7 million Americans (age 12 and older) are estimated to have a mild SUD, 5.2 million a moderate SUD, and 4.6 million a severe SUD. The two greatest predictors of treatment receipt are addiction severity and probation status. People with severe opioid use disorder have the greatest probability of treatment receipt with a 55.6% predicted probability of receiving treatment, while people with a mild alcohol use disorder are the least likely to receive treatment with a predicted probability of 1.8% receiving treatment. People with mild alcohol use disorder make up the largest proportion of people identified as needing but not receiving treatment when assuming all people with a diagnosis need treatment. Conclusions Improving use of existing specialty addiction treatment capacity to address the needs of the 8.5 million Americans with moderate or severe SUD and better use of the general health care system to treat mild or stable SUD may be a better focus for health system planners and government than adding new capacity for specialty treatment.;,citation_author=Kimberly Johnson;,citation_author=Khary K.

Design A meta-analysis and meta-regression of all possible studies (randomized controlled trials and longitudinal) which incorporated EMA protocols, examining substance use. Setting Studies took place from 1998 to 2017, in numerous countries world-wide.

It is not known how often commercially insured adults obtain follow-up treatment after nonfatal opioid overdose.To investigate the incidence of follow-up treatment following emergency department discharge after nonfatal opioid overdose and patient characteristics associated with receipt of follow-up treatment.A retrospective cohort study was conducted using an administrative claims database for a large US commercial insurer, from October 1, 2011, to September 30, 2016. Data analysis was performed from May 1, 2019, to September 26, 2019. Adult patients discharged from the emergency department after an index opioid overdose (no overdose in the preceding 90 days) were included. Patients with cancer and without continuous insurance enrollment were excluded.The primary outcome was follow-up treatment in the 90 days following overdose, defined as a combined outcome of claims for treatment encounters or medications for opioid use disorder (buprenorphine and naltrexone). Analysis was stratified by whether patients received treatment for opioid use disorder in the 90 days before the overdose. Logistic regression models were used to identify patient characteristics associated with receipt of follow-up treatment. Marginal effects were used to report the average adjusted probability and absolute risk differences (ARDs) in follow-up for different patient characteristics.A total of 6451 patients were identified with nonfatal opioid overdose; the mean (SD) age was 45.0 (19.3) years, 3267 were women (50.6%), and 4676 patients (72.5%) reported their race as non-Hispanic white. A total of 1069 patients (16.6%; 95% CI, 15.7%-17.5%) obtained follow-up treatment within 90 days after the overdose. In adjusted analysis of patients who did not receive treatment before the overdose, black patients were half as likely to obtain follow-up compared with non-Hispanic white patients (ARD, -5.9%; 95% CI, -8.6% to -3.6%). Women (ARD, -1.7%; 95% CI, -3.3% to -0.5%) and Hispanic patients (ARD, -3.5%; 95% CI, -6.1% to -0.9%) were also less likely to obtain follow-up.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Personalized Treatment of Alcohol Dependence;,citation_abstract=Pharmacogenetic and adaptive treatment approaches can be used to personalize care for alcohol-dependent patients. Preliminary evidence shows that variation in the gene encoding the $\mu$-opioid receptor moderates the response to naltrexone when used to treat alcohol dependence. Studies have also shown moderating effects of variation in the gene encoding the serotonin transporter on response to serotonergic treatment of alcohol dependence. Adaptive algorithms that modify alcohol treatment based on patients’ progress have also shown promise. Initial response to outpatient treatment appears to be a particularly important in the selection of optimal continuing care interventions. In addition, stepped-care algorithms can reduce the cost and burden of treatment while maintaining good outcomes. Finally, matching treatment to specific problems present at intake or that emerge during treatment can also improve outcomes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Beyond sigmoids: How to obtain well-calibrated probabilities from binary classifiers with beta calibration;,citation_abstract=For optimal decision making under variable class distributions and misclassification costs a classifier needs to produce well-calibrated estimates of the posterior probability. Isotonic calibration is a powerful non-parametric method that is however prone to overfitting on smaller datasets; hence a parametric method based on the logistic sigmoidal curve is commonly used. While logistic calibration is designed for normally distributed per-class scores, we demonstrate experimentally that many classifiers including Naive Bayes and Adaboost suffer from a particular distortion where these score distributions are heavily skewed. In such cases logistic calibration can easily yield probability estimates that are worse than the original scores. Moreover, the logistic curve family does not include the identity function, and hence logistic calibration can easily uncalibrate a perfectly calibrated classifier. In this paper we solve all these problems with a richer class of parametric calibration maps based on the beta distribution. We derive the method from first principles and show that fitting it is as easy as fitting a logistic curve. Extensive experiments show that beta calibration is superior to logistic calibration for a wide range of classifiers: Naive Bayes, Adaboost, random forest, logistic regression, support vector machine and multi-layer perceptron. If the original classifier is already calibrated, then beta calibration learns a function close to the identity. On this we build a statistical test to recognise if the model deviates from being well-calibrated.;,citation_author=Meelis Kull;,citation_author=Telmo M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A systematic review of rural-specific barriers to medication treatment for opioid use disorder in the United States;,citation_abstract=Opioid-related deaths have risen dramatically in rural communities. Prior studies highlight few medication treatment providers for opioid use disorder in rural communities, though literature has yet to examine rural-specific treatment barriers. We conducted a systematic review to highlight the state of knowledge around rural medication treatment for opioid use disorder, identify consumer- and provider-focused treatment barriers, and discuss rural-specific implications. We systematically reviewed the literature using PsycINFO, Web of Science, and PubMed databases (January 2018). Articles meeting inclusion criteria involved rural samples or urban/rural comparisons targeting outpatient medication treatment for opioid use disorder, and were conducted in the U.S. to minimize healthcare differences. Our analysis categorized consumer- and/or provider-focused barriers, and coded barriers as related to treatment availability, accessibility, and/or acceptability. Eighteen articles met inclusion, 15 which addressed consumer-focused barriers, while seven articles reported provider-focused barriers. Availability barriers were most commonly reported across consumer (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;10) and provider (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;5) studies, and included the lack of clinics/providers, backup, and resources. Acceptability barriers, described in three consumer and five provider studies, identified negative provider attitudes about addiction treatment, and providers’ perceptions of treatment as unsatisfactory for rural patients. Finally, accessibility barriers related to travel and cost were detailed in four consumer-focused studies whereas two provider-focused studies identified time constraints. Our findings consistently identified a lack of medication providers and rural-specific implementation challenges. This review highlights a lack of rural-focused studies involving consumer participants, treatment outcomes, or barriers impacting underserved populations.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A unified approach to interpreting model predictions;,citation_abstract=Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction’s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.;,citation_author=Scott M.

In this critical review, we provide an overview of sex/gender differences in the biology, epidemiology and treatment of SUDs. Biological sex differences are evident across an array of systems, including brain structure and function, endocrine function, and metabolic function. Gender (i.e., environmentally and socioculturally defined roles for men and women) also contributes to the initiation and course of substance use and SUDs. Adverse medical, psychiatric, and functional consequences associated with SUDs are often more severe in women. However, men and women do not substantively differ with respect to SUD treatment outcomes. Although several trends are beginning to emerge in the literature, findings on sex and gender differences in SUDs are complicated by the interacting contributions of biological and environmental factors. Future research is needed to further elucidate sex and gender differences, especially focusing on hormonal factors in SUD course and treatment outcomes; research translating findings between animal and human models; and gender differences in understudied populations, such as those with co-occurring psychiatric disorders and gender-specific populations, such as pregnant women.;,citation_author=R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Treatment use, sources of payment, and financial barriers to treatment among individuals with opioid use disorder following the national implementation of the ACA;,citation_abstract=Introduction Despite increasing rates of opioid misuse and hospitalizations, rates of treatment for those with opioid use disorder (OUD) are very low. This study examined the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) insurance expansion on improving rates of insurance, health care access, and treatment for those with OUD. Methods Data on individuals ages 18–64 with OUD come from the 2008–2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N=4100). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the trends of health care insurance, treatment and barriers to care across the stages of ACA implementation: pre-ACA (2008–2009), partial-ACA (2010–2013), and national implementation (2014). All models were adjusted for predisposing, enabling, and need factors. Results In both adjusted and unadjusted comparisons, national implementation of the ACA was associated with significant improvements in outcome measures for those with OUD. Multivariable analyses indicate that, after national implementation, those with OUD were significantly less likely to be uninsured and were less likely to report financial barriers as a reason for not receiving substance use treatment, relative to the pre-ACA period. Individuals were also more likely to receive substance use treatment and were more likely to report that insurance paid for treatment after national implementation of the ACA relative to the pre-ACA period. These results persisted when national implementation was compared relative to partial-implementation. Conclusions National implementation of the ACA has helped to reduce rates of uninsurance, barriers to care, and improve rates of substance use treatment for those with OUD.;,citation_author=Ryan M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Drug dependence, a chronic medical illness: Implications for treatment, insurance, and outcomes evaluation;,citation_abstract=The effects of drug dependence on social systems has helped shape the generally held view that drug dependence is primarily a social problem, not a health problem. In turn, medical approaches to prevention and treatment are lacking. We examined evidence that drug (including alcohol) dependence is a chronic medical illness. A literature review compared the diagnoses, heritability, etiology (genetic and environmental factors), pathophysiology, and response to treatments (adherence and relapse) of drug dependence vs type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma. Genetic heritability, personal choice, and environmental factors are comparably involved in the etiology and course of all of these disorders. Drug dependence produces significant and lasting changes in brain chemistry and function. Effective medications are available for treating nicotine, alcohol, and opiate dependence but not stimulant or marijuana dependence. Medication adherence and relapse rates are similar across these illnesses. Drug dependence generally has been treated as if it were an acute illness. Review results suggest that long-term care strategies of medication management and continued monitoring produce lasting benefits. Drug dependence should be insured, treated, and evaluated like other chronic illnesses. JAMA. 2000;284:1689-1695.;,citation_author=A. T. McLellan;,citation_author=D. C. Lewis;,citation_author=C. P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Model Cards for Model Reporting;,citation_abstract=Trained machine learning models are increasingly used to perform high-impact tasks in areas such as law enforcement, medicine, education, and employment. In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type [15]) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related artificial intelligence technology, increasing transparency into how well artificial intelligence technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.;,citation_author=Margaret Mitchell;,citation_author=Simone Wu;,citation_author=Andrew Zaldivar;,citation_author=Parker Barnes;,citation_author=Lucy Vasserman;,citation_author=Ben Hutchinson;,citation_author=Elena Spitzer;,citation_author=Inioluwa Deborah Raji;,citation_author=Timnit Gebru;,citation_publication_date=2019-01;,citation_cover_date=2019-01;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993;,citation_doi=10.1145/3287560.3287596;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_conference_title=Proceedings of the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Building health behavior models to guide the development of just-in-time adaptive interventions: A pragmatic framework;,citation_abstract=Advances in wireless devices and mobile technology offer many opportunities for delivering just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs)–suites of interventions that adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and circumstances with the goal to address the individual’s need for support, whenever this need arises. A major challenge confronting behavioral scientists aiming to develop a JITAI concerns the selection and integration of existing empirical, theoretical and practical evidence into a scientific model that can inform the construction of a JITAI and help identify scientific gaps. The purpose of this paper is to establish a pragmatic framework that can be used to organize existing evidence into a useful model for JITAI construction. This framework involves clarifying the conceptual purpose of a JITAI, namely the provision of just-in-time support via adaptation, as well as describing the components of a JITAI and articulating a list of concrete questions to guide the establishment of a useful model for JITAI construction. The proposed framework includes an organizing scheme for translating the relatively static scientific models underlying many health behavior interventions into a more dynamic model that better incorporates the element of time.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) in Mobile Health: Key Components and Design Principles for Ongoing Health Behavior Support;,citation_abstract=Background: The just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) is an intervention design aiming to provide the right type/amount of support, at the right time, by adapting to an individual’s changing internal and contextual state. The availability of increasingly powerful mobile and sensing technologies underpins the use of JITAIs to support health behavior, as in such a setting an individual’s state can change rapidly, unexpectedly, and in his/her natural environment. Purpose: Despite the increasing use and appeal of JITAIs, a major gap exists between the growing technological capabilities for delivering JITAIs and research on the development and evaluation of these interventions. Many JITAIs have been developed with minimal use of empirical evidence, theory, or accepted treatment guidelines. Here, we take an essential first step towards bridging this gap. Methods: Building on health behavior theories and the extant literature on JITAIs, we clarify the scientific motivation for JITAIs, define their fundamental components, and highlight design principles related to these components. Examples of JITAIs from various domains of health behavior research are used for illustration. Conclusions: As we enter a new era of technological capacity for delivering JITAIs, it is critical that researchers develop sophisticated and nuanced health behavior theories capable of guiding the construction of such interventions.

Treatment programs are increasingly utilizing buprenorphine, an effective OUD medication. This exploratory study examines sex and gender differences in psychosocial, clinical, and substance use treatment characteristics of a clinical population in outpatient medication treatment for OUD with buprenorphine. This is a secondary data analysis from a cross-sectional survey study with retrospective medical record review conducted with patients recruited from an office-based opioid treatment clinic between July–September 2019. Participants on buprenorphine for at least 28 days at time of survey completion were included (n = 133). Differences between men and women were explored with Pearson $\chi^2$ and Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables and T-tests for continuous variables. The sample was 55.6% women and nearly three fourths Black (70.7%). Mean days in current treatment episode was 431.6 (SD = 244.82). Women were younger and more likely to be unemployed, identify as a sexual minority, and live alone with children than men. More women than men had a psychiatric comorbidity. Women reported more prescription opioid misuse while men had more heroin only opioid use. More men reported comorbid alcohol use and a history of drug overdose. One third of participants reported recent discrimination in a health care setting due to substance use. As buprenorphine-based outpatient treatment programs continue to expand, present study findings support evaluation of the unique needs of men and women in order to better tailor OUD-related services and improve treatment outcomes.

Methods Data were pooled from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health survey years 2015, 2016, and 2017. Analyses were limited to adult White, Black, and Latino participants who met DSM-IV criteria for a past-year substance use disorder (n = 12,070). Hierarchical multivariate logistic regression models examined the role of race/ethnicity on past-year use of (1) any substance abuse treatment services and (2) specialty treatment. Important covariates included socio-demographics, problem severity, and perceived treatment need. A sub-analysis was also conducted that was limited to participants who reported having health insurance to explore the role of insurance status on treatment utilization by race/ethnicity. Results Findings showed that Latinos and Blacks significantly underutilized specialty treatment relative to Whites. These relationships were statistically significant after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, problem severity, and perceived treatment need. However, when analyses were limited to only those with health insurance, Black-White disparities became non-significant, while Latino-White disparities persisted.

Findings suggest psychiatric severity should be considered when assigning clients to outpatient therapies. The lack of other robust matching effects suggests that providers need not take these CLAs into account when triaging clients to 1 or the other of these 3 individually delivered treatment approaches, despite their different treatment philosophies.;,citation_author=U.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Ethnic disparities in clinical severity and services for alcohol problems: Results from the National Alcohol Survey;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: This study reports lifetime estimates of the extent of unmet need for alcohol services across the 3 largest ethnic groups in America, and examines factors that may contribute to ethnic differences in service use. Prior studies report mixed findings as to the existence of ethnic disparities in alcohol services, with some suggesting that minorities are over-represented in treatment settings. METHODS: Drawing on the most recent National Alcohol Surveys, we compare rates and factors associated with the lifetime service use for alcohol problems among Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics who meet lifetime criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence. RESULTS: While bivariate analyses revealed few ethnic differences in service use, there were significant differences by ethnicity in multivariate models that included alcohol problem severity and its interactions with ethnicity. At higher levels of problem severity, both Hispanics and Blacks were less likely to have utilized services than comparable Whites. Hispanics, on the whole, reported higher-severity alcohol problems than Whites. Yet, they were less likely to have received specialty treatment and multiple types of alcohol services, and were more likely to cite economic and logistical barriers as reasons for not obtaining care. CONCLUSIONS: Future efforts to study ethnic disparities in alcohol services should utilize analytic approaches that address potential confounding between ethnicity and other factors in service use, such as alcohol problem severity. Our findings suggest that Hispanics and Blacks with higher-severity alcohol problems may utilize services at lower rates than comparable Whites, and that, particularly for Hispanics, this may in part be attributable to financial and logistical barriers to care.;,citation_author=Laura A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pooled and person-specific machine learning models for predicting future alcohol consumption, craving, and wanting to drink: A demonstration of parallel utility;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The specific factors driving alcohol consumption, craving, and wanting to drink, are likely different for different people. The present study sought to apply statistical classification methods to idiographic time series data in order to identify person-specific predictors of future drinking-relevant behavior, affect, and cognitions in a college student sample. DESIGN: Participants were sent 8 mobile phone surveys per day for 15 days. Each survey assessed the number of drinks consumed since the previous survey, as well as positive affect, negative affect, alcohol craving, drinking expectancies, perceived alcohol consumption norms, impulsivity, and social and situational context. Each individual’s data were split into training and testing sets, so that trained models could be validated using person-specific out-of-sample data. Elastic net regularization was used to select a subset of a set of 40 variables to be used to predict either alcohol consumption, craving, or wanting to drink, forward in time. SETTING: A west-coast university. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three university students who had consumed alcohol in their lifetime. MEASUREMENTS: Mobile phone surveys. FINDINGS: Averaging across participants, accurate out-of-sample predictions of future drinking were made 76% of the time. For craving, the mean out-of-sample R$^2$ value was .27. For wanting to drink, the mean out-of-sample R$^2$ value was .27. CONCLUSION: Using a person-specific constellation of psychosocial and temporal variables, it may be possible to accurately predict drinking behavior, affect, and cognitions before they occur.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Targeting the Barriers in the Substance Use Disorder Continuum of Care With Peer Recovery Support;,citation_abstract=Substance Use Disorder (SUD) has been recognized as a chronic, relapsing disorder. However, much of existing SUD care remains based in an acute care model that focuses on clinical stabilization and discharge, failing to address the longer-term needs of people in recovery from addiction. The high rates of client’s disengagement and attrition across the continuum of care highlight the need to identify and overcome the obstacles that people face at each stage of the treatment and recovery process. Peer recovery support services (PRSS) show promise in helping people initiate, pursue, and sustain long-term recovery from substance-related problems. Based on a comprehensive review of the literature, the goal of this article is to explore the possible roles of peers along the SUD care continuum and their potential to improve engagement in care by targeting specific barriers that prevent people from successfully transitioning from one stage to the next leading eventually to full recovery. A multidimensional framework of SUD care continuum was developed based on the adapted model of opioid use disorder cascade of care and recovery stages, within which the barriers known to be associated with each stage of the continuum were matched with the existing evidence of effectiveness of specific PRSSs. With this conceptual paper, we are hoping to show how PRSSs can become a complementary and integrated part of the system of care, which is an essential step toward improving the continuity of care and health outcomes.;,citation_author=Milena Stanojlović;,citation_author=Larry Davidson;,citation_publication_date=2021-01;,citation_cover_date=2021-01;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.1177/1178221820976988;,citation_issn=1178-2218;,citation_volume=15;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Substance Abuse: Research and Treatment;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd STM;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Facing Addiction in America: The Surgeon General’s Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health;,citation_abstract=This Surgeon General’s Report has been created because of the important health and social problems associated with alcohol and drug misuse in America. As described in this Report, a comprehensive approach is needed to address substance use problems in the United States that includes several key components: Enhanced public education to improve awareness about substance use problems and demand for more effective policies and practices to address them; Widespread implementation of evidence-based prevention policies and programs to prevent substance misuse and related harms; Improved access to evidence-based treatment services, integrated with mainstream health care, for those at risk for or affected by substance use disorders; Recovery support services (RSS) to assist individuals in maintaining remission and preventing relapse; and Research-informed public policies and financing strategies to ensure that substance misuse and use disorder services are accessible, compassionate, efficient, and sustainable. Recognizing these needs, the Report explains the neurobiological basis for substance use disorders and provides the biological, psychological, and social frameworks for improving diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of alcohol and drug misuse. It also describes evidence-based prevention strategies, such as public policies that can reduce substance misuse problems (e.g., driving under the influence [DUI]); effective treatment strategies, including medications and behavioral therapies for treating substance use disorders; and RSS for people who have completed treatment. Additionally, the Report describes recent changes in health care financing, including changes in health insurance regulations, which support the integration of clinical prevention and treatment services for substance use disorders into mainstream health care practice, and defines a research agenda for addressing alcohol and drug misuse as medical conditions. Thus, this first Surgeon General’s Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health is not issued simply because of the prevalence of substance misuse or even the related devastating harms and costs, but also to help inform policymakers, health care professionals, and the general public about effective, practical, and sustainable strategies to address these problems. These strategies have the potential to substantially reduce substance misuse and related problems; promote early intervention for substance misuse and substance use disorders; and improve the availability of high-quality treatment and RSS for persons with substance use disorders.;,citation_author=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (US);,citation_author=Office of the Surgeon General (US);,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_pmid=28252892;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_series_title=Reports of the Surgeon General;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using machine learning to identify predictors of imminent drinking and create tailored messages for at-risk drinkers experiencing homelessness;,citation_abstract=Adults experiencing homelessness are more likely to have an alcohol use disorder compared to adults in the general population. Although shelter-based treatments are common, completion rates tend to be poor, suggesting a need for more effective approaches that are tailored to this understudied and underserved population. One barrier to developing more effective treatments is the limited knowledge of the triggers of alcohol use among homeless adults. This paper describes the use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to identify predictors of “imminent drinking” (i.e., drinking within the next 4&nbsp;h), among a sample of adults experiencing homelessness and receiving health services at a homeless shelter. A total of 78 mostly male (84.6%) adults experiencing homelessness (mean age&nbsp;=&nbsp;46.6) who reported hazardous drinking completed up to five EMAs per day over 4&nbsp;weeks (a total of 4557 completed EMAs). The study used machine learning techniques to create a drinking risk algorithm that predicted 82% of imminent drinking episodes within 4&nbsp;h of the first drink of the day, and correctly identified 76% of nondrinking episodes. The algorithm included the following 7 predictors of imminent drinking: urge to drink, having alcohol easily available, feeling confident that alcohol would improve mood, feeling depressed, lower commitment to being alcohol free, not interacting with someone drinking alcohol, and being indoors. The research team used the results to develop intervention content (e.g., brief tailored messages) that will be delivered when imminent drinking is detected in an upcoming intervention phase. Specifically, we created three theoretically grounded message tracks focused on urge/craving, social/availability, and negative affect/mood, which are further tailored to a participant’s current drinking goal (i.e., stay sober, drink less, no goal) to support positive change. To our knowledge, this is the first study to develop tailored intervention messages based on likelihood of imminent drinking, current drinking triggers, and drinking goals among adults experiencing homelessness.;,citation_author=Scott T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Just-in-the-Moment Adaptive Interventions (JITAI): A Meta-Analytical Review;,citation_abstract=A just-in-time, adaptive intervention (JITAI) is an emerging type of intervention that provides tailored support at the exact time of need. It does so using enabling new technologies (e.g., mobile phones, sensors) that capture the changing states of individuals. Extracting effect sizes of primary outcomes produced by 33 empirical studies that used JITAIs, we found moderate to large effect sizes of JITAI treatments compared to (1) waitlist-control conditions (k&nbsp;=&nbsp;9), Hedges’s g =&nbsp;1.65 and (2) non-JITAI treatments (k&nbsp;=&nbsp;21), g =&nbsp;0.89.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST): Development, reliability and feasibility;,citation_abstract=AIMS: The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) was developed for the World Health Organization (WHO) by an international group of substance abuse researchers to detect psychoactive substance use and related problems in primary care patients. This report describes the new instrument as well as a study of its reliability and feasibility. SETTING: The study was conducted at participating sites in Australia, Brazil, Ireland, India, Israel, the Palestinian Territories, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and Zimbabwe. Sixty per cent of the sample was recruited from alcohol and drug abuse treatment facilities; the remainder was drawn from general medical settings and psychiatric facilities. METHODS: The study was concerned primarily with test item reliability, using a simple test-retest procedure to determine whether subjects would respond consistently to the same items when presented in an interview format on two different occasions. Qualitative and quantitative data were also collected to evaluate the feasibility of the screening items and rating format. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 236 volunteer participants completed test and retest interviews at nine collaborating sites. Slightly over half of the sample (53.6%) was male. The mean age of the sample was 34 years and they had completed, on average, 10 years of education. RESULTS: The average test-retest reliability coefficients (kappas) ranged from a high of 0.90 (consistency of reporting ’ever’ use of substance) to a low of 0.58 (regretted what was done under influence of substance). The average kappas for substance classes ranged from 0.61 for sedatives to 0.78 for opioids. In general, the reliabilities were in the range of good to excellent, with the following items demonstrating the highest kappas across all drug classes: use in the last 3 months, preoccupied with drug use, concern expressed by others, troubled by problems related to drug use, intravenous drug use. Qualitative data collected at the end of the retest interview suggested that the questions were not difficult to answer and were consistent with patients’ expectations for a health interview. The data were used to guide the selection of a smaller set of items that can serve as the basis for more extensive validation research. CONCLUSION: The ASSIST items are reliable and feasible to use as part of an international screening test. Further evaluation of the screening test should be conducted.;,citation_author=WHO ASSIST Working Group;,citation_publication_date=2002-09;,citation_cover_date=2002-09;,citation_year=2002;,citation_issue=9;,citation_issn=0965-2140;,citation_pmid=12199834;,citation_volume=97;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Addiction (Abingdon, England);">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Modeling the complexity of post-treatment drinking: It’s a rocky road to relapse;,citation_abstract=The most widely cited road block to successful treatment outcomes for psychological and substance use disorders has been described as the return to the previous behavior, or “relapse.” The operational definition of “relapse” varies from study to study and between clinicians, but in general the term is used to indicate the return to previous levels of symptomatic behavior. One explanation for the variation in the operationalization of relapse is the wide variety of behaviors for which the term is applied, including (but not limited to): depression, substance abuse, schizophrenia, mania, sexual offending, risky sexual behavior, dieting, and the anxiety disorders. A second explanation for the multitude of definitions for relapse is the inherent complexity in the process of behavior change. In this paper we present the most recent treatment outcome research evaluating relapse rates, with a special focus on the substance use disorders. Following this review of the literature we present an argument for the operationalization of relapse as a dynamic process, which can be empirically characterized using dynamical systems theory. We support this argument by presenting results from the analysis of alcohol treatment outcomes using catastrophe modeling techniques. These results demonstrate the utility of catastrophe theory in modeling the alcohol relapse process. The implications of these analyses for the treatment of alcohol use disorders, as well as a discussion of future research incorporating nonlinear dynamical systems theory is provided.;,citation_author=Katie Witkiewitz;,citation_author=G.

The ability to assess thoughts, feelings, behavior, physiology, and context intensively and repeatedly in the moment in an individual’s natural ecology affords access to data that can answer exciting questions about sequences of events and dynamic processes in daily life. Ambulatory assessment also holds unique promise for developing personalized models of individuals (i.e., precision or person-specific assessment) that might be transformative for applied settings such as clinical practice. However, successfully translating ambulatory assessment from bench to bedside is challenging because of the inherent tension between idiographic and nomothetic principles of measurement.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Acceptability of Personal Sensing Among People With Alcohol Use Disorder: Observational Study;,citation_abstract=Background: Personal sensing may improve digital therapeutics for mental health care by facilitating early screening, symptom monitoring, risk prediction, and personalized adaptive interventions. However, further development and the use of personal sensing requires a better understanding of its acceptability to people targeted for these applications. Objective: We aimed to assess the acceptability of active and passive personal sensing methods in a sample of people with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder using both behavioral and self-report measures. This sample was recruited as part of a larger grant-funded project to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict lapses. Methods: Participants (N=154; n=77, 50% female; mean age 41, SD 11.9 years; n=134, 87% White and n=150, 97% non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1-8 weeks of abstinence) were recruited to participate in a 3-month longitudinal study. Participants were modestly compensated for engaging with active (eg, ecological momentary assessment [EMA], audio check-in, and sleep quality) and passive (eg, geolocation, cellular communication logs, and SMS text message content) sensing methods that were selected to tap into constructs from the Relapse Prevention model by Marlatt. We assessed 3 behavioral indicators of acceptability: participants’ choices about their participation in the study at various stages in the procedure, their choice to opt in to provide data for each sensing method, and their adherence to a subset of the active methods (EMA and audio check-in). We also assessed 3 self-report measures of acceptability (interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year) for each method. Results: Of the 192 eligible individuals screened, 191 consented to personal sensing. Most of these individuals (169/191, 88.5%) also returned 1 week later to formally enroll, and 154 participated through the first month follow-up visit. All participants in our analysis sample opted in to provide data for EMA, sleep quality, geolocation, and cellular communication logs. Out of 154 participants, 1 (0.6%) did not provide SMS text message content and 3 (1.9%) did not provide any audio check-ins. The average adherence rate for the 4 times daily EMA was .80. The adherence rate for the daily audio check-in was .54. Aggregate participant ratings indicated that all personal sensing methods were significantly more acceptable (all P&amp;amp;amp;lt;.001) compared with neutral across subjective measures of interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year. Participants did not significantly differ in their dislike of active methods compared with passive methods (P=.23). However, participants reported a higher willingness to use passive (vs active) methods for 1 year (P=.04). Conclusions: These results suggest that active and passive sensing methods are acceptable for people with alcohol use disorder over a longer period than has previously been assessed. Important individual differences were observed across people and methods, indicating opportunities for future improvement.;,citation_author=Kendra Wyant;,citation_author=Hannah Moshontz;,citation_author=Stephanie B.

Model features were based on raw scores and longitudinal change in theoretically implicated risk factors collected through ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Participants (N=151; 51% male; mean age = 41; 87% White, 97% Non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1–8 weeks of abstinence) from alcohol use disorder provided 4x daily EMA for up to three months. We used grouped, nested cross-validation, with 1 repeat of 10-fold cross-validation for the inner loop and 3 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation for the outer loop to train models, select best models, and evaluate those best models on auROC. Models yielded median areas under the receiver operating curves (auROCs) of .90, .91, and .94 in the 30 held-out test sets for week, day, and hour level models, respectively. Some feature categories consistently emerged as being globally important to lapse prediction across our week, day, and hour level models (i.e., past use, future efficacy). However, most of the more punctuate, time varying constructs (e.g., craving, past stressful events, arousal) appear to have greater impact within the next hour prediction model. This research represents an important step toward the development of a smart (machine learning guided) sensing system that can both identify periods of peak lapse risk and recommend specific supports to address factors contributing to this risk. General scientific summary: This study suggests that densely sampled self-report data can be used to predict lapses back to alcohol use with varying degrees of temporal precision. Additionally, the contextual features contributing to risk of lapse may offer important insight for treatment matching through a digital therapeutic.;,citation_author=Kendra Wyant;,citation_author=Sarah June Kittleson Sant’Ana;,citation_author=Gaylen Fronk;,citation_author=John J.

        <p>We evaluated machine learning models predicting future alcohol lapses within 24-hour prediction windows that were systematically lagged further into the future (1 day, 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks). We engineered features from 4x daily ecological momentary assessment. Participants (N=151; 51% male; mean age=41; 87% White, 97% Non-Hispanic) in early recovery from alcohol use disorder provided data for up to three months. We used nested cross-validation to select and evaluate models. Median posterior probabilities for auROCs were high (0.84–0.90). Still, performance declined with increasing lags (probabilities &gt; .98). Models also performed worse for disadvantaged groups (not White vs.&nbsp;non-Hispanic White, below poverty vs.&nbsp;above poverty, female vs.&nbsp;male; probabilities &gt; .96). This study demonstrates the feasibility of predicting next-day alcohol lapses up to two weeks into the future. This advanced notice offers time to implement support options not immediately available. However, fairness concerns remain and are discussed further in the paper.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Alcohol and other substance use disorders (SUDs) are serious chronic conditions, characterized by high relapse rates<span class="citation" data-cites="mclellanDrugDependenceChronic2000 dennisManagingAddictionChronic2007">(<a href="#ref-mclellanDrugDependenceChronic2000" role="doc-biblioref">McLellan et al. 2000</a>; <a href="#ref-dennisManagingAddictionChronic2007" role="doc-biblioref">Dennis and Scott 2007</a>)</span>, substantial co-morbidity with other physical and mental health problems<span class="citation" data-cites="substanceabuseandmentalhealthservicesadministration2023NSDUHDetailed dennisManagingAddictionChronic2007">(<a href="#ref-substanceabuseandmentalhealthservicesadministration2023NSDUHDetailed" role="doc-biblioref">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration n.d.</a>; <a href="#ref-dennisManagingAddictionChronic2007" role="doc-biblioref">Dennis and Scott 2007</a>)</span>, and an increased risk of mortality <span class="citation" data-cites="hedegaardDrugOverdoseDeaths centersfordiseasecontrolandpreventioncdcAnnualAverageUnited">(<a href="#ref-hedegaardDrugOverdoseDeaths" role="doc-biblioref">Hedegaard et al. n.d.</a>; <a href="#ref-centersfordiseasecontrolandpreventioncdcAnnualAverageUnited" role="doc-biblioref">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) n.d.</a>)</span>. Too few individuals receive medications or clinician-delivered interventions to help them initially achieve abstinence and/or reduce harms associated with their use <span class="citation" data-cites="substanceabuseandmentalhealthservicesadministration2023NSDUHDetailed">(<a href="#ref-substanceabuseandmentalhealthservicesadministration2023NSDUHDetailed" role="doc-biblioref">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration n.d.</a>)</span>. Yet, this problem is even worse for subsequent continuing care during SUD recovery. Continuing care, including both risk monitoring and ongoing support, is the gold standard for managing chronic health conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and HIV. Yet, continuing care for SUDs is largely lacking despite ample evidence that SUDs are chronic, relapsing conditions <span class="citation" data-cites="substanceabuseandmentalhealthservicesadministration2023NSDUHDetailed stanojlovicTargetingBarriersSubstance2021 sociasAdoptingCascadeCare2016">(<a href="#ref-substanceabuseandmentalhealthservicesadministration2023NSDUHDetailed" role="doc-biblioref">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration n.d.</a>; <a href="#ref-stanojlovicTargetingBarriersSubstance2021" role="doc-biblioref">Stanojlović and Davidson 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-sociasAdoptingCascadeCare2016" role="doc-biblioref">Socías, Volkow, and Wood 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>When available, an important focus of continuing care during SUD recovery is the prevention of lapses (i.e., single instances of goal-inconsistent substance use) and full relapse back to harmful use <span class="citation" data-cites="marlattRelapsePreventionMaintenance1985 witkiewitzRelapsePreventionAlcohol2004">(<a href="#ref-marlattRelapsePreventionMaintenance1985" role="doc-biblioref">Marlatt and Gordon 1985</a>; <a href="#ref-witkiewitzRelapsePreventionAlcohol2004" role="doc-biblioref">Witkiewitz and Marlatt 2004</a>)</span>. Critically, the risk factors that instigate lapses during recovery are individualized, numerous, dynamic, interactive, and non-linear <span class="citation" data-cites="witkiewitzModelingComplexityPosttreatment2007 brandonRelapseRelapsePrevention2007">(<a href="#ref-witkiewitzModelingComplexityPosttreatment2007" role="doc-biblioref">Witkiewitz and Marlatt 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-brandonRelapseRelapsePrevention2007" role="doc-biblioref">Brandon, Vidrine, and Litvin 2007</a>)</span>. Therefore, the optimal supports to address these risk factors and encourage continued, successful recovery vary both across individuals and within an individual over time. Given this, continuing care could benefit greatly from a precision mental health approach that seeks to provide the right support to the right individual at the right time, every time <span class="citation" data-cites="bickmanAchievingPrecisionMental2016 derubeisHistoryCurrentStatus2019 kranzlerPersonalizedTreatmentAlcohol2012">(<a href="#ref-bickmanAchievingPrecisionMental2016" role="doc-biblioref">Bickman, Lyon, and Wolpert 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-derubeisHistoryCurrentStatus2019" role="doc-biblioref">DeRubeis 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-kranzlerPersonalizedTreatmentAlcohol2012" role="doc-biblioref">Kranzler and McKay 2012</a>)</span>. However, such monitoring and personalized support must also be highly scalable to address the substantial unmet need for SUD continuing care.</p>
<p>Recent advances in both smartphone sensing <span class="citation" data-cites="mohrPersonalSensingUnderstanding2017">(<a href="#ref-mohrPersonalSensingUnderstanding2017" role="doc-biblioref">Mohr, Zhang, and Schueller 2017</a>)</span> and machine learning <span class="citation" data-cites="hastieElementsStatisticalLearning2009">(<a href="#ref-hastieElementsStatisticalLearning2009" role="doc-biblioref">Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 2009</a>)</span> hold promise as a scalable foundation for monitoring and personalized support during SUD recovery. Smartphone sensing approaches (e.g., ecological momentary assessment, geolocation sensing) can provide the frequent, longitudinal measurement of proximal risk factors that is necessary for prediction of future lapses with high temporal precision. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) may be particularly well-suited for lapse prediction because it can provide privileged access to the subjective experiences (e.g., craving, affect, stress, motivation, self-efficacy) that are targets for change in evidence based approaches for relapse prevention <span class="citation" data-cites="marlattRelapsePreventionMaintenance1985 witkiewitzRelapsePreventionAlcohol2004 bowenMindfulnessBasedRelapsePrevention2021">(<a href="#ref-marlattRelapsePreventionMaintenance1985" role="doc-biblioref">Marlatt and Gordon 1985</a>; <a href="#ref-witkiewitzRelapsePreventionAlcohol2004" role="doc-biblioref">Witkiewitz and Marlatt 2004</a>; <a href="#ref-bowenMindfulnessBasedRelapsePrevention2021" role="doc-biblioref">Bowen et al. 2021</a>)</span>. Furthermore, individuals with SUDs have found EMA to be acceptable for sustained measurement for up to a year with relatively high compliance <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantAcceptabilityPersonalSensing2023 moshontzProspectivePredictionLapses2021">(<a href="#ref-wyantAcceptabilityPersonalSensing2023" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al. 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-moshontzProspectivePredictionLapses2021" role="doc-biblioref">Moshontz et al. 2021</a>)</span>, suggesting that this method is feasible for long-term monitoring throughout SUD recovery.</p>
<p>Machine learning models are well-positioned to use EMAs as inputs to provide temporally precise prediction of the probability of future lapses with sufficiently high performance to support decisions about interventions and other supports for specific individuals. These models can handle the high dimensional feature sets that may result from feature engineering densely sampled raw EMA over time <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMachineLearningModels2023">(<a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2023" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al. 2024</a>)</span>. They can also accommodate non-linear and interactive relationships between features and lapse probability that are likely necessary for accurate prediction of lapse probability. And rapid advances in the tools for interpretable machine learning (e.g, Shapley values <span class="citation" data-cites="lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017">(<a href="#ref-lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017" role="doc-biblioref">Lundberg and Lee 2017</a>)</span>) now allow us to probe these models to understand which risk features contribute most strongly to a lapse prediction for a specific individual at a specific moment in time. Interventions, supports, and/or lifestyle adjustments can then be personalized to address these risks following from our understanding about relapse prevention.</p>
<p>Preliminary research is now emerging that uses features derived from EMAs in machine learning models to predict the probability of future alcohol use <span class="citation" data-cites="baeMobilePhoneSensors2018 soysterPooledPersonspecificMachine2022 waltersUsingMachineLearning2021 chihPredictiveModelingAddiction2014">Wyant et al. (<a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2023" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span>. This research is important because it rigorously required strict temporal ordering necessary for true prediction, with features measured before alcohol use outcomes. It also used resampling methods (e.g., cross-validation) that prioritize model generalizability to increase the likelihood these models will perform well with new people. And perhaps most importantly, <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMachineLearningModels2023">Wyant et al. (<a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2023" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> demonstrated that machine learning models using EMA can provide predictions with very high temporal precision at clinically implementable levels of performance. Specifically, they developed models that predict lapses in the immediate future (i.e., the next day and even the next hour) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 and 0.93, respectively.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMachineLearningModels2023">Wyant et al. (<a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2023" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span>’s next day lapse prediction model can provide personalized support recommendations to address immediate risks for possible lapses in that next day. Features derived from past EMAs can be updated in the early morning to yield the predicted lapse probability for an individual that day. Personalized supports that target the top features contributing to that prediction can be provided to assist them that day. For example, if predicted lapse probability is high due to recent frequent craving, they could be reminded about the benefits of urge surfing or distracting activities during brief periods when cravings arise. Conversely, guided relaxation techniques could be recommended if lapse probability was high due to recent past and anticipated stressors that day. Patients could also be assisted to implement any of these recommendations by videos or other tools within a digital therapeutic. Curtin and colleagues are currently evaluating outcomes associated with the use of this “smart” (machine learning guided) monitoring and personalized support system for patients in recovery from alcohol use disorder <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantOptimizingMessageComponentsinprep">(<a href="#ref-wyantOptimizingMessageComponentsinprep" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al. in prep</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Despite the promise offered by a monitoring and personalized support system based on immediate future risks (e.g., the next day), such a system has limitations. Most importantly, recommendations must be limited to previously learned skills and/or supports that are available to implement that day. However, many risks may require supports that are not available in the moment. For example, to address lifestyle imbalances, several future positive activities may need to be planned. Time with supportive friends or an AA sponsor to help with many risks may require time to schedule. Similarly, work or family schedules may need to be adjusted to return to attending self-help meetings. If new recovery skills or therapeutic activities are needed to address emerging risks, sessions with a therapist may need to be booked to assist the patient to acquire these new skills. In all of these instances, patients would benefit from advanced warning about changes in their lapse probability and the associated risks that contribute to these changes. A smart monitoring and personalized support system could provide this advanced warning by lagging lapse probability predictions further into the future (e.g., predicting lapse probability in a 24-hour window that begins two weeks in the future). However, we do not know if such lagged models could maintain adequate performance for clinical use with individuals.</p>
<p>In this study, we evaluated the performance of machine learning models that predict the probability of future lapses within 24-hour prediction windows that were systematically lagged further into the future. We considered several meaningful lags for these prediction windows: 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks. We conducted pre-registered analyses of both the absolute performance of these lagged models and their relative performance compared to a baseline model that predicted lapse probability in the immediate next day (i.e., no lag). In addition to the aggregate performance of these models, we also evaluated algorithmic fairness by comparing model performance across important subgroups that have documented disparities in treatment access and/or outcomes. These include comparisons by race/ethnicity <span class="citation" data-cites="pinedoCurrentReexaminationRacial2019 kilaruIncidenceTreatmentOpioid2020">(<a href="#ref-pinedoCurrentReexaminationRacial2019" role="doc-biblioref">Pinedo 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-kilaruIncidenceTreatmentOpioid2020" role="doc-biblioref">Kilaru et al. 2020</a>)</span>, income <span class="citation" data-cites="olfsonHealthcareCoverageService2022">(<a href="#ref-olfsonHealthcareCoverageService2022" role="doc-biblioref">Olfson et al. 2022</a>)</span>, and sex at birth <span class="citation" data-cites="greenfieldSubstanceAbuseTreatment2007 kilaruIncidenceTreatmentOpioid2020">(<a href="#ref-greenfieldSubstanceAbuseTreatment2007" role="doc-biblioref">Greenfield et al. 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-kilaruIncidenceTreatmentOpioid2020" role="doc-biblioref">Kilaru et al. 2020</a>)</span>. Finally, we calculated Shapley values for feature categories defined by EMA items to better understand how these models make their prediction and how these features can be used to recommend personalized supports.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transparency-and-openness">Transparency and Openness</h2>
<p>We adhere to research transparency principles that are crucial for robust and replicable science. We preregistered our data analytic strategy. We reported how we determined the sample size, all data exclusions, all manipulations, and all study measures. We provide a transparency report in the supplement. Finally, our data, questionnaires and other study materials are publicly available on our OSF page (<a href="https://osf.io/xta67/">https://osf.io/xta67/</a>), and our annotated analysis scripts and results are publicly available on our study website (<a href="https://jjcurtin.github.io/study_lag/">https://jjcurtin.github.io/study_lag/</a>).</p>

<section id="participants" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="participants">Participants</h2>
<p>We recruited participants in early recovery (1-8 weeks of abstinence) from moderate to severe alcohol use disorder in Madison, Wisconsin, US for a three month longitudinal study. Participants were recruited through print and targeted digital advertisements and partnerships with treatment centers. We required that participants:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>were age 18 or older,</li>
<li>could write and read in English,</li>
<li>had at least moderately severe alcohol use disorder (&gt;= 4 self-reported DSM-5 symptoms),</li>
<li>were abstinent from alcohol for 1-8 weeks, and</li>
<li>were willing to use a single smartphone (personal or study provided) while on study.</li>
</ol>
<p>We also excluded participants exhibiting severe symptoms of psychosis or paranoia.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>One hundred ninety-two participants were eligible. Of these, 191 consented to participate in the study at the screening visit, and 169 subsequently enrolled in the study at the enrollment visit, which occurred approximately one week later. Fifteen participants discontinued before the first monthly follow-up visit. We excluded data from one participant who did not maintain a goal of abstinence during their participation. We also excluded data from two participants due to evidence of careless responding and unusually low compliance. Our final sample consisted of 151 participants. This sample size was determined based on traditional power analysis methods for logistic regression <span class="citation" data-cites="hsiehSampleSizeTables1989">(<a href="#ref-hsiehSampleSizeTables1989" role="doc-biblioref">Hsieh 1989</a>)</span> because comparable approaches for machine learning models have not yet been validated.</p>
</section>
<section id="procedure" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="procedure">Procedure</h2>
<p>Participants completed five study visits over approximately three months. After an initial phone screen, participants attended an in-person screening visit to determine eligibility, complete informed consent, and collect self-report measures. Eligible, consented participants returned approximately one week later for an intake visit. Three additional follow-up visits occurred about every 30 days that participants remained on study. Participants were expected to complete four daily EMAs while on study. Other personal sensing data streams (geolocation, cellular communications, sleep quality, and audio check-ins) were collected as part of the parent grant’s aims (R01 AA024391). Participants could earn up to $150/month if they completed all study visits, had 10% or less missing EMA data and opted in to provide data for other personal sensing data streams.</p>

<p>Participants completed four brief (7-10 questions) EMAs daily. The first and last EMAs of the day were scheduled within one hour of participants’ typical wake and sleep times. The other two EMAs were scheduled randomly within the first and second halves of their typical day, with at least one hour between EMAs. Participants learned how to complete the EMA and the meaning of each question during their intake visit.</p>
<p>On all EMAs, participants reported dates/times of any previously unreported past alcohol use. Next, participants rated the maximum intensity of recent (i.e., since last EMA) experiences of craving, risky situations, stressful events, and pleasant events. Finally, participants rated their current affect on two bipolar scales: valence (Unpleasant/Unhappy to Pleasant/Happy) and arousal (Calm/Sleepy to Aroused/Alert).</p>
<p>On the first EMA each day, participants also rated the likelihood of encountering risky situations and stressful events in the next week and the likelihood that they would drink alcohol in the next week (i.e., abstinence self-efficacy).</p>

<p>We collected self-report information about demographics (age, sex at birth, race, ethnicity, education, marital status, employment, and income) and clinical characteristics (AUD milestones, number of quit attempts, lifetime AUD treatment history, lifetime receipt of AUD medication, DSM-5 AUD symptom count, current drug use <span class="citation" data-cites="whoassistworkinggroupAlcoholSmokingSubstance2002">(<a href="#ref-whoassistworkinggroupAlcoholSmokingSubstance2002" role="doc-biblioref">WHO ASSIST Working Group 2002</a>)</span>, and presence of psychological symptoms <span class="citation" data-cites="derogatislBriefSymptomInventory">(<a href="#ref-derogatislBriefSymptomInventory" role="doc-biblioref">Derogatis, L.R., n.d.</a>)</span>) to characterize our sample. DSM-5 AUD symptom count and presence of psychological symptoms were also used to determine eligibility. Demographic information was included as features in our models. A subset of these variables (sex at birth, race, ethnicity, and income) were used for model fairness analyses, as they have documented disparities in treatment access and outcomes.</p>
<p>As part of the aims of the parent project we collected many other trait and state measures throughout the study. A complete list of all measures can be found on our study’s OSF page.</p>

<section id="predictions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="predictions">Predictions</h3>
<p>A <em>prediction timepoint</em> (<a href="#fig-method" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>, Panel A) is the hour at which our model calculates a predicted probability of a lapse within a future 24-hour prediction window for any specific individual. We calculated the features used to make predictions at each prediction timepoint within a feature scoring epoch that included all available EMAs up until, but not including, the prediction timepoint. The first prediction timepoint for each participant was 24 hours from midnight on their study start date. This ensured at least 24 hours of past EMAs were available in the feature scoring epoch. Subsequent prediction timepoints for each participant repeatedly rolled forward hour-by-hour until the end of their study participation.</p>
<p>The <em>prediction window</em> (<a href="#fig-method" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>, Panel B) spans a period of time in which a lapse might occur. The prediction window width for all models was 24 hours (i.e., models predicted the probability of a lapse occurring within a specific 24-hour period). Prediction windows rolled forward hour-by-hour with the prediction timepoint. However, there were five possible <em>lag times</em> between the prediction timepoint and start of the associated prediction window. A prediction window either started immediately after the prediction time point (no lag) or was lagged by 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, or 2 weeks into the future.</p>
<p>Given this structure, our models provided hour-by-hour predicted probabilities of an alcohol lapse in a future 24 hour period. Depending on the model, that future period (the prediction window) might start immediately after the prediction timepoint or up to 2 weeks into the future. For example, at midnight on the 30th day of participation, the feature scoring epoch would include the past 30 days of EMAs. Separate models would predict the probability of lapse for 24 hour periods staring at midnight that day, or similar 24 hour periods starting 1 day, 3 days, 1 week or 2 weeks after midnight on day 30.</p>

<section id="labels" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="labels">Labels</h3>
<p>The start and end date/time of past drinking episodes were reported on the first EMA item. A prediction window was labeled <em>lapse</em> if the start date/hour of any drinking episode fell within that window. A window was labeled <em>no lapse</em> if no alcohol use occurred within that window +/- 24 hours. If no alcohol use occurred within the window but did occur within 24 hours of the start or end of the window, the window was excluded. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>We ended up with a total of 274,179 labels for our baseline (no lag) model, 270,911 labels for our 1-day lagged model, 264,362 labels for our 3-day lagged model, 251,458 labels for our 1-week lagged model, and 228,420 labels for our 2-week lagged model.</p>
</section>
<section id="feature-engineering" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feature-engineering">Feature Engineering</h3>
<p>Features were calculated using only data collected in feature scoring epochs before each prediction timepoint to ensure our models were making true future predictions. For our no lag models the prediction timepoint was at the start of prediction window, so all data prior to the start of the prediction window was included. For our lagged models, the prediction timepoint was 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, or 2 weeks prior to the start of the prediction window, so the last EMA data used for feature engineering were collected 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, or 2 weeks prior to the start of the prediction window.</p>
<p>A total of 285 features were derived from three data sources:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Prediction window</em>: We dummy-coded features for day of the week for the start of the prediction window.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Demographics</em>: We created quantitative features for age (in years) and personal income (in dollars), and dummy-coded features for sex at birth (male vs.&nbsp;female), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White vs.&nbsp;not White), marital status (married vs.&nbsp;not married vs.&nbsp;other), education (high school or less vs.&nbsp;some college vs.&nbsp;college degree), and employment (employed vs.&nbsp;unemployed).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Previous EMA responses</em>: We created raw and change features using EMAs in varying feature scoring epochs (i.e., 12, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours) before the prediction timepoint for all EMA items. Raw features included min, max, and median scores for each EMA item across all EMAs in each epoch for that participant. We calculated change features by subtracting each participant’s baseline mean score for each EMA item from their raw feature. These baseline mean scores were calculated using all of their EMAs collected from the start of their participation until the start of the prediction window. We also created raw and change features based on the most recent response for each EMA question and raw and change rate features from previously reported lapses and number of completed EMAs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Other generic feature engineering steps included imputing missing data (median imputation for numeric features, mode imputation for nominal features) and removing zero and near-zero variance features as determined from held-in data (see Cross-validation section below).</p>

<section id="model-configurations" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-configurations">Model Configurations</h4>
<p>We trained and evaluated five separate classification models: one baseline (no lag) model and one model for 1 day, 3 day, 1 week, and 2 week lagged predictions. We considered four well-established statistical algorithms (elastic net, XGBoost, regularized discriminant analysis, and single layer neural networks) that vary across characteristics expected to affect model performance (e.g., flexibility, complexity, handling higher-order interactions natively) <span class="citation" data-cites="kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018">(<a href="#ref-kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018" role="doc-biblioref">Kuhn and Johnson 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Candidate model configurations differed across sensible values for key hyperparameters. They also differed on outcome resampling method (i.e., no resampling and up-sampling and down-sampling of the outcome using majority/no lapse to minority/lapse ratios ranging from 1:1 to 5:1).</p>
</section>
<section id="cross-validation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cross-validation">Cross-validation</h4>
<p>We used participant-grouped, nested cross-validation for model training, selection, and evaluation with auROC. auROC indexes the probability that the model will predict a higher score for a randomly selected positive case (lapse) relative to a randomly selected negative case (no lapse). Grouped cross-validation assigns all data from a participant as either held-in or held-out to avoid bias introduced when predicting a participant’s data from their own data. We used 1 repeat of 10-fold cross-validation for the inner loops (i.e., <em>validation</em> sets) and 3 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation for the outer loop (i.e., <em>test</em> sets). Best model configurations were selected using median auROC across the 10 validation sets. Final performance evaluation of those best model configurations used median auROC across the 30 test sets.</p>
</section>
<section id="bayesian-model" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bayesian-model">Bayesian Model</h4>
<p>We used a Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model to estimate the posterior probability distributions and 95% Bayesian credible intervals (CIs) from the 30 held-out test sets for our five best models. Following recommendations from the rstanarm team and others <span class="citation" data-cites="rstudioteamRStudioIntegratedDevelopment2020 gabryPriorDistributionsRstanarm2023">(<a href="#ref-rstudioteamRStudioIntegratedDevelopment2020" role="doc-biblioref">RStudio Team 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-gabryPriorDistributionsRstanarm2023" role="doc-biblioref">Gabry and Goodrich 2023</a>)</span>, we used the rstanarm default autoscaled, weakly informative, data-dependent priors that take into account the order of magnitude of the variables to provide some regularization to stabilize computation and avoid over-fitting.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> We set two random intercepts to account for our resampling method: one for the repeat, and another for the fold nested within repeat. We specified two sets of pre-registered contrasts for model comparisons. The first set compared each lagged model to the baseline no lag model (no lag vs.&nbsp;1-day lag, no lag vs.&nbsp;3-day lag, no lag vs.&nbsp;1-week lag, no lag vs.&nbsp;2-week lag). The second set compared adjacently lagged models (1-day lag vs.&nbsp;3-day lag, 3-day lag vs.&nbsp;1-week lag, 1-week lag vs.&nbsp;2-week lag). auROCs were transformed using the logit function and regressed as a function of model contrast.</p>
<p>From the Bayesian model we obtained the posterior distribution (transformed back from logit) and Bayeisan CIs for auROCs all five models. To evaluate our models’ overall performance we report the median posterior probability for auROC and Bayesian CIs. This represents our best estimate for the magnitude of the auROC parameter for each model. If the credible intervals do not contain .5 (chance performance), this provides strong evidence (&gt; .95 probability) that our model is capturing signal in the data.</p>
<p>We then conducted Bayesian model comparisons using our two sets of contrasts - baseline and adjacent lags. For both model comparisons, we determined the probability that the models’ performances differed systematically from each other. We also report the precise posterior probability for the difference in auROCs and the 95% Bayesian CIs.</p>
</section>
<section id="fairness-analyses" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fairness-analyses">Fairness Analyses</h4>
<p>We calculated the median posterior probability and 95% Bayesian CI for auROC for each model separately by race/ethnicity (not White vs.&nbsp;non-Hispanic White), income (below poverty vs.&nbsp;above poverty<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>), and sex at birth (female vs.&nbsp;male). We conducted Bayesian group comparisons to assess the likelihood that each model performs differently by group. We summarize the differences in posterior probabilities for auROC across models. Individual Bayesian fairness contrasts for all five models are available in the supplement.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</section>
<section id="feature-importance" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feature-importance">Feature Importance</h4>
<p>We calculated Shapley values in log-odds units for binary classification models from the 30 test sets to provide a description of the importance of categories of features across our five models <span class="citation" data-cites="lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017">(<a href="#ref-lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017" role="doc-biblioref">Lundberg and Lee 2017</a>)</span>. We averaged the three Shapley values for each observation for each feature (i.e., across the three repeats) to increase their stability. An inherent property of Shapley values is their additivity, allowing us to combine features into feature categories. We created separate feature categories for each of the nine EMA questions, and the rate of past alcohol use. We calculated the local (i.e., for each observation) importance for each category of features by adding Shapley values across all features in a category, separately for each observation. We calculated global importance for each feature category by averaging the absolute value of the Shapley values of all features in the category across all observations. These local and global importance scores based on Shapley values allow us to contextualize relative feature importance for each model.</p>

<p>Histograms of the full posterior probability distributions for auROC for each model are available in the supplement. The median auROCs from these posterior distributions were 0.90 (no lag), 0.88 (1-day lag), 0.87 (3-day hour lag), 0.86 (1-week lag), and 0.84 (2-week lag). These values represent our best estimates for the magnitude of the auROC parameter for each model. The 95% Bayesian CI for the auROCs for these models were relatively narrow and did not contain 0.5: no lag [0.88-0.92], 1-day lag [0.86-0.90], 3-day lag [0.85-0.89], 1-week lag [0.84-0.88], 2-week lag [0.81-0.86].</p>

<p><a href="#tbl-model" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;2</a> presents the median difference in auROC, 95% Bayesian CI, and posterior probability that that the auROC difference was greater than 0 for our no lag and 2-week lag models for the three fairness contrasts: race/ethnicity (not White; <em>N</em> = 20 vs.&nbsp;Non-Hispanic White; <em>N</em> = 131), sex at birth (female; <em>N</em> = 74 vs.&nbsp;male; <em>N</em> = 77), and income (below poverty; <em>N</em> = 49 vs.&nbsp;above poverty; <em>N</em> = 102). Individual Bayesian fairness contrasts for all five models are available in the supplement. There was strong evidence (probabilities &gt; .96) that our models performed better for the advantaged groups (White, male, above poverty) compared to the disadvantaged groups (not-White, female, below poverty). On average there was a median decrease in auROC of 0.15 (range 0.11-0.27) for participants who were not White compared to non-Hispanic White participants. On average there was a median decrease in auROC of 0.05 (range 0.04-0.10) for female participants compared to male participants. On average there was a median decrease in auROC of 0.04 (range 0.03-0.06) for participants below the federal poverty line compared to participants above the federal poverty line.</p>

<section id="model-performance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-performance">Model Performance</h2>
<p>Our models performed exceptionally well with median posterior probabilities for auROCs of .84 - .90. This suggests we can achieve clinically meaningful performance up to two weeks out. Our rigorous resampling methods (grouped, nested, k-fold cross-validation) make us confident that these are valid estimates of how our models would perform with new individuals.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, model performance did decrease as models predicted further into the future. This is unsurprising given what we know about prediction and substance use. Many important relapse risk factors are fluctuating processes that can change day-by-day, if not more frequently. As lag time increases, features become less proximal to the prediction time point. Still, we wish to emphasize that our lowest auROC (.84) is still excellent, and the benefit of advanced notice likely outweighs the cost to performance.</p>
<p>The relative ordering of important features remained somewhat consistent across models. Past use, future efficacy, and craving were the top three features for all models. However the magnitude of their importance varried somewhat by lag time. Additionally, for the two-week model future risky situations emerged as an important feature, whereas with the no lag model past stressful events were more important. <!--KW: John, not sure how to interpret these differences. The difference in importance of future efficacy seems the most noteworthy difference--></p>

<section id="model-fairness" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-fairness">Model Fairness</h2>
<p>All models performed worse for people who were not White, and for people who had an income below the poverty line. The largest contributing factor is likely the lack of diversity in our training data. For example, even with our coarse combination of race/ethnicity, the not White group was largely underrepresented relative to the non-Hispanic White group. Similarly, our below poverty group was underrepresented relative to the above poverty group.</p>
<p>One obvious potential solution to this problem is to recruit a more representative sample. In a separate project, we recruited a national sample of participants with opioid use disorder <span class="citation" data-cites="moshontzProspectivePredictionLapses2021">(<a href="#ref-moshontzProspectivePredictionLapses2021" role="doc-biblioref">Moshontz et al. 2021</a>)</span>. In addition to achieving better representation in income and race/ethnicity, we also ensured diversity across geographic location (e.g., rural vs.&nbsp;urban) as this is likely another important factor in evaluating fairness.</p>
<p>Computational solutions to mitigate these issues in the current data may also exist. We could explore upsampling disadvantaged group representation in the data (e.g., using synthetic minority oversampling technique). We also could adjust the penalty weights so that prediction errors for disadvantaged groups are weighted more heavily than prediction errors for majority groups. We could also consider using personalized modeling approaches that consider the characteristics and behaviors important to an individual rather than generalizing across a population. For example, state space models inherently capture time series data and allow for the modeling of how an individual’s risk evolves over time from observable and latent states.</p>
<p>The models also performed more poorly for women compared to men, despite the fact that they were well represented. This finding suggests representation in our data is not the only factor affecting model fairness. We chose our EMA items based on domain expertise and years of relapse risk research. It is possible that these constructs more precisely describe relapse risk factors for men than for women. This could mean that more research is needed to identify relapse risk factors for women (and other groups underrepresented in the literature more broadly). Additionally, data driven (bottom-up) approaches to creating features could be one way to remove some of the bias in domain driven (top-down) approaches. For example, using natural language processing on text message content could allow for new categories of features to emerge.</p>

<section id="additional-limitations-and-future-directions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-limitations-and-future-directions">Additional Limitations and Future Directions</h2>
<p>We believe lapse prediction models will be most effective when embedded in a recovery monitoring and support system designed to deliver adaptive and personalized continuing care. This system could send daily, weekly, or less frequent messages to patients with personalized feedback about their risk of lapse and provide support recommendations tailored to their current recovery needs. As described earlier, we previously built day- and hour-level models to predict the probability of an immediate lapse (i.e., within 24 hours, within 1 hour). We can use these models with high temporal precision to guide individuals to take actionable steps to maintain their recovery goals and support them in implementing these steps (e.g., pointing them to a specific module in an app).</p>
<p>This study demonstrated lagged models can be used to shift the 24-hour prediction window up to weeks out. This lag provides individuals with advanced warning of their lapse risk. These models are well-suited to support recovery needs that cannot be addressed within an app, such as scheduling an appointment or attending a support group. To be clear, we do not believe an app alone is sufficient to deliver continuing care. We expect individuals will require additional support throughout their recovery from a mental health provider (e.g., motivational enhancement, crisis management, skill building), a peer (e.g., sponsor, support group), or family member. Importantly, these types of supports take time to set up; highlighting the value of the lagged week model.</p>
<p>Despite building successful prediction models, it is still unclear the best way to provide risk and support information to people. For a recovery monitoring and support system to be successful, it is important that participants trust the system, engage with the system and find the system beneficial. In an ongoing grant, our group is working to optimize the delivery of daily support messages by examining whether the inclusion or exclusion of risk-relevant message components (e.g., lapse probability, lapse probability change, important features, and a risk-relevant recommendation) increase engagement in recovery tools and supports, trust in the machine learning model, and improve clinical outcomes <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantOptimizingMessageComponentsinprep">(<a href="#ref-wyantOptimizingMessageComponentsinprep" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al. in prep</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>For a system using lagged models, we can imagine that even longer lags (i.e., more advanced warning) would be better still. In the present study, we were limited by how much time we could lag predictions. Participants only provided EMA for up to three months. Therefore, a lag time of two weeks between the prediction time point and start of the prediction window means data from 2 out of the 12 possible weeks is not being used. This loss of data could be one reason we saw a decrease in model performance with increased lag times. In a separate NIH protocol underway, participants are providing EMA and other sensed data for up to 12 months <span class="citation" data-cites="moshontzProspectivePredictionLapses2021">(<a href="#ref-moshontzProspectivePredictionLapses2021" role="doc-biblioref">Moshontz et al. 2021</a>)</span>. By comparing models built from these two datasets, we will better be able to evaluate whether this loss of data impacted model performance and if we can sustain similar performance with even longer lags in these data.</p>
<p>A recovery monitoring and support system will require new data to update model predictions. A model only using EMA could raise measurement burden concerns. Research suggests people can comply with effortful sensing methods (e.g., 4x daily EMA) while using substances <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantAcceptabilityPersonalSensing2023 jonesComplianceEcologicalMomentary2019">(<a href="#ref-wyantAcceptabilityPersonalSensing2023" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al. 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-jonesComplianceEcologicalMomentary2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jones et al. 2019</a>)</span>. However, it is likely that frequent daily surveys will eventually become too burdensome when considering long-term monitoring. We have begun to address this by building models with fewer EMAs (1x daily) and have found comparable performance<!--John - I cant find any preprints or references online for Eric's paper-->. Additionally, reinforcement learning could potentially be used for adaptive EMA sampling. For example, each day the algorithm could make a decision to send out an EMA or not based on inferred latent states of the individual based on previous EMA responses and predicted probability of lapse.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have begun to explore how we can supplement our models with data from other lower burden sensing methods. Geolocation is a passive sensing method that could compliment EMA well. First, it could provide insight into information not easily captured by self-report. For example, the amount of time spent in risky locations, or changes in routine that could indicate life stressors. Second, the near-continuous sampling of geolocation could offer risk-relevant information that would otherwise be missed in between the discrete sampling periods of EMA. Ultimately, passive sensing offers the opportunity to capture additional risk features that would be difficult to measure with self-report or would add additional burden by increasing the number of questions on the EMA.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This study suggests it is possible to predict next day alcohol lapses up to two weeks into the future. This advanced notice could allow patients to implement support options not immediately available. Important steps are still needed to make these models clinically implementable. Most notably, is the increased fairness in model performance. However, we remain optimistic as we have already begun to take several steps in addressing these barriers.</p>

<li id="fn2"><p>We used this conservative 24-hour fence for labeling windows as no lapse (vs.&nbsp;excluded) to increase the fidelity of these labels. Given that most windows were labeled no lapse, and the outcome was highly unbalanced, it was not problematic to exclude some no lapse events to further increase confidence in those labels.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Priors were set as follows: residual standard deviation ~ normal(location=0, scale=exp(2)), intercept (after centering predictors) ~ normal(location=2.3, scale=1.3), the two coefficients for window width contrasts ~ normal (location=0, scale=2.69), and covariance ~ decov(regularization=1, concentration=1, shape=1, scale=1).<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn5"><p>For our fairness analyses, we altered our outer loop resampling method from 3 x 10 cross-validation to 6 x 5 cross-validation.
