    "\n",
    "-   Prior to analyzing the complete data set, a time-stamped preregistration was posted in an independent, third-party registry for the data analysis plan: Yes\n",

    "Comments about your Preregistration: We pre-registered our data analytic strategy on OSF.\n",

    "### Methods Section\n",
    "\n",
    "The manuscript fully describes…\n",
    "\n",
    "-   the rationale for the sample size used (e.g., an a priori power analysis): Yes  \n",
    "-   how participants were recruited: Yes  \n",
    "-   how participants were selected (e.g., eligibility criteria): Yes  \n",
    "-   what compensation was offered for participation: Yes  \n",
    "-   how participant dropout was handled (e.g., replaced, omitted, etc): Yes  \n",
    "-   how participants were assigned to conditions: N/A. There are no conditions.  \n",
    "-   how stimulus materials were randomized: N/A.  \n",
    "-   whether (and, if so, how) participants, experimenters, and data-analysts were kept naive to potentially biasing information: N/A. This is an observations study that does not include analysis of group or manipulations. There were no study conditions to blind.  \n",

    "-   describes how violations of statistical assumptions were handled: No  \n",
    "-   justifies all statistical choices (e.g., including or excluding covariates; applying or not applying transformations; use of multi-level models vs. ANOVA): Yes  \n",
    "-   reports the sample size for each cell of the design: Yes  \n",
    "-   reports how incomplete or missing data were handled: Yes  \n",
    "-   presents protocols for data preprocessing (e.g., cleaning, discarding of cases and items, normalizing, smoothing, artifact correction): Yes\n",
